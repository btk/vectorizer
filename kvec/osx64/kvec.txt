--------!-ABOUT_KVEC-E----------------------
What is KVEC?

KVEC is a freeware program that allows you to convert raster graphics to
vector graphics. You can freely use it. 
Before 2010 it was distributed as shareware. Please download the freeware version
from the kvec web site.
It can be freely distributed and copied. 
KVEC is very exacting with respect to memory demands. Vectorizing is a
critical process and often leads to a trade off between memory demands
and performance. It is crucial for the performance that your computer has enough
RAM. 

The selection of values for the switch parameters requires some caution.
Noisy pictures (typical for scanned colour pictures) or pictures with a lot of
very small details should be evaluated with larger 'grit values' and smaller 
'quantize values' (explained below).
The output formats DXF and HPGL are not suited for vectorization of coloured
photos or coloured scanned pictures (unless you have lots of GigaBytes left
on your harddisk ;-) the output size would be immense.

Vector representations of images have several advantages in contrast to
rastered block representations: operations like rotation, stretching, morphing
and warping can much easier be performed and one does not have to care about
aliasing and other unwanted effects. The application fields of a good 
vectorizer reach from motion estimating in video sequences up to effective
image compression.

Please feel free to contact the author if you have problems with KVEC
or if you find some bugs. KVEC is designed to run on several operating systems
(which have different hardware and graphical environments), therefore this 
release of KVEC is a graphic-independend commandline version. 

The syntax is quite simple:

     KVEC (Inputfile) (Outputfile) [optional switches]
     for example:
     KVEC test.bmp test.dxf -format dxf

Wildcards ('*' and '?' ) are allowed for the file names.
Nested subdirectories were not processed when using wildcards.
If the input filename contains wildcards, the outputfilenames will be derived
from the expanded input filenames and get different file suffixes. In the case
of identical input and output filenames KVEC adds an leading underscore ('_')
to the output filename in order to prevent overwriting. Full pathnames can be 
specified for input files and output files.

You can also start KVEC using a parameter file (KVEC.PAR) by typing:

     KVEC -readpar parfilename

[filename] is the (optional) name of a KVEC parameter file.
The name of the parameter file must be KVEC.PAR (uppercase), if no filename
for the parameter file is specified.
You can use any of the example parameter files in the KVEC package (*.par).
Please note: The last line in a parameter file should be terminated by a
CR or a LF char. Otherwise it may not work for the linux or MAC-OS operating
systems.

--------!-sequence-E------------------------
Since version 3.90 you can start KVEC in 'sequenz-mode' by specifying two
parameter files and an optional parameter <nseq>:

     KVEC -readpar parfilename1  parfilename2  <nseq>

This will produce a sequence of <nseq+1> still images generated by gradually
interpolating all parameter values going from the values in parameterfile1
to the values in parameterfile2. If no value for nseq is specified, a value
of nseq = 100 will be taken.
Important: The input/output filenames in parfilename1 must be identical with
those in parameterfile2. 'vnull' or 'null' (see below) together with the
internal random or demo images is also allowed.
The generated outputfiles will have indices (6 digits). Existing files will
be overwritten without prompting. 
You can use any other conversion software to convert this sequence to one
video file and create nice animations (e.g. animated function plots). 
Future releases of KVEC will also allow different input files for the two
parameterfiles and thus generate true morphing sequences. 



--------!-intro_in-E------------------------
Inputfile is the name of a raster graphic file (Tiff, BMP, PCX, TGA, SGI,
IMG, PNM, JPEG, GIF, WPG, PNG or FAX).
If the name of the input-file is 'null' KVEC will create a 'white noise'
random or other test raster images. 
If the name of the input-file is 'vnull' KVEC will create a random
vector image. The properties of this test image depend on 
the parameter settings for the '-random' switch.

--------!-intro_out-E-----------------------
Outputfile is the name of the desired vector graphic file.
Please note that the name of the output file must be specified with the
filename extension. You cannot omit it.

Note:
If the input-file has already a vector-format (WMF or ART), most of the
switches will be disregarded. In this case KVEC only performs a format-
conversion from one vector format to another vector format.


Currently supported vector formats are:
      - Windows Metafile, Postscript, AutoCad DXF, HPGL, LogoArt ART,
        Adobe Illustrator Format, XFIG, PCS and the KVEC format KVC
        SVG(Z) (Scalable vector format), SWF 6.x (Macromedia Flash Format)
        DST (Tajiama stick format), HTML

The switches are optional. If you don't specify any switches, the program
chooses a set of parameters which are optimized with respect to the kind of
graphic data. Switches may be abbreviated.
The filenames must be specified before the optional switches.
Some switches however don't require filenames and can be specified immediately 
after KVEC. From these switches only one can be specified in each case:

--------!-ehelp-E---------------------------
KVEC -ehelp <topic> Displays help information in English language

--------!-ghelp-E---------------------------
KVEC -ghelp <topic> Displays help information in German language

--------!-info-E----------------------------
KVEC -info:        Displays some useful information about KVEC on the screen.

--------!-printform-E-----------------------
KVEC -printform:   Automatically generates a registration form. This form can
                   be sent to the author by E-Mail, Fax, or postal mail in 
                   order to get a registration key. The registration key is
                   a max. 5 digit number, which allows the user to register
                   the software and get access to extended features of KVEC.
                   You will be prompted to select a language. The registration
                   form will then be generated in your preferred language.
                   The registration form consists of plain ASCII text.
                   If you print it out from a text processing program, be
                   sure that you choose a monospaced font and not a
                   proportional font. For users from the European countries
                   a special registration form is available from:
          www.kvec.de/files/download/kvec_reg_info_eng/reg_info_eng_europe.htm
                  
--------!-register-E------------------------
KVEC -register:    As soon as you get a registration key you can use this
                   switch to register the program. You will be prompted to
                   enter your name, the serial-number, and your registration 
                   key. Please type all characters exactly as printed in the 
                   registration confirmation you receive from the author. If
                   you have entered the information correctly, a message
                   appears which thanks you for your registration. The
                   received registration key is valid for updates and future
                   releases of KVEC.

--------!-readpar-E-------------------------
KVEC -readpar:     KVEC reads filenames and additional parameters from a
                   parameter file (KVEC.PAR) rather than the commandline.
                   Please note, that the parameter file must reside in the
                   actual working directory. The parameter file KVEC.PAR
                   is an ASCI file and can be edited with any text editor.
                   Comments in the parameter file must be marked by a
                   #-character and may appear anywhere behind a parameter
                   or at the beginning of a line.

KVEC -readpar [filename]:
                   KVEC reads filenames and additional parameters from the
                   specified parameter file [filename].

--------!-rename-E--------------------------
KVEC *.jpg *.jpg -rename: (only Windows version). This is a very special 
                   switch for renaming multiple files. The renamed filenames
                   will have the prefix: "high_". This is useful in order to 
                   prepare input files together with the switch "-html". 
                   Generally this will be applied to jpg-files. Here 
                   an example: 'kvec image*.jpg *.jpg -rename'

--------!-writepar-E------------------------
KVEC -writepar:    Generates a KVEC parameter file. The user will be prompted
                   to enter filenames and additional parameters.         
                   The name of the parameter file is always 'KVEC.PAR'    
                   and will reside in the actual directory.             
                   You can add comments behind the parameters you are
                   promped to input (see above). Parameters always begin with
                   a leading '-'character. After the parameter file has been
                   written, the program should be restarted using the
                   '-readpar' option.

KVEC -writepar [filename]:
                   Generates a KVEC parameter file with the specified
                   filename. 

--------!-end of writepar-E-----------------

The other switches must follow the input and output filenames:

--------!-antialiasing-E--------------------
-antialiasing <N>: (Only for Vector-Raster-Conversion): Anti-Aliasing will
                   be applied when rendering.
                   <N>: 0: no antialiasing, 1: good quality, 2: best quality
                   <-N>: the same as <N> but will generate more compact lines


--------!-bezier-E--------------------------
-bezier:           The output will consist of bezier-curves instead of
                   straight lines. This allows you to zoom the image without
                   getting edges. For the output formats which don't support
                   bezier curves, the bezier algorithm will
                   be simulated and approximated by polylines.

--------!-bkcolor-E-------------------------
-bkcolor <r> <g> <b>: background color for plotting user-defined functions
                   (see switch '-function')

--------!-black-E---------------------------
-black:            Output color for vectorization is always black

--------!-centerline-E----------------------
-centerline mixed: The effect of this parameter depends on the value of the
                   parameter -lwidth. (If used together with -centerline,
                   the meaning of the parameter -lwidth is modified).
                   Before vectorizing, all detected objects were checked for
                   its maximal thickness. All objects with a maximal
                   thickness less than -lwidth were treated as line objects;
                   all other objects were vectorized in the normal way.
                   The vectorization of line objects does not result in
                   border lines around the objects. It produces single lines
                   which are located along the centerlines of the objects.
                   The final linewidth of this generated single lines will
                   be adopted so that the area of the line object is about
                   the same as the area of the original object.
                   (this has no effect, if the output format cannot handle
                   variable linewidths). This is the DEFAULT.

-centerline lines: The same as 'centerline mixed' except that only line
                   objects will be generated. All other objects will be
                   discarded.
-centerline off:   Turns centerline vectorization off (Default)

--------!-colspace-E------------------------
                   Selects the internal color space which is used by kvec.
                   The effect of changing the internal color space will be
                   noticed when used together with the "colorsep" option
                   or when bitmap processing is performed ("process" option).
-colspace rgb:     RGB color space (default).
-colspace rb:      RB color space 
-colspace gb:      GB color space 
-colspace gr:      RG color space 
-colspace cmyk:    CMYK color space
-colspace cy:      CY color space
-colspace my:      MY color space
-colspace mc:      CM color space
                   Note: If a color space other than RGB or CMYK is selected,
                   the colors will be changed such that the optical
                   impression will be quite near to the original image.

--------!-colseparation-E-------------------
                   Selects the type of color separation. The output file  
                   will only contain the specified color components.
                   Please note, that for cmyk separation the color space is
                   also set to the right value.
-colsep rgb:       no color separation (default).
-colsep cmyk:      no color separation 
-colsep rb:        extract R and B components 
-colsep gb:        extract G and B components 
-colsep gr:        extract R and G components 
-colsep cy:        extract C and Y components
-colsep my:        extract M and Y components
-colsep mc:        extract C and M components
-colsep rr:        separate R color 
-colsep gg:        separate G color 
-colsep bb:        separate B color 
-colsep cc:        separate C color 
-colsep mm:        separate M color 
-colsep yy:        separate Y color 
                   Note: It is useful to produce a gray-scale output file 
                   for single component color separation. This can be
                   achieved by using the "-black" option together with colsep.

--------!-coord-E---------------------------
                   Specifies the type of internal scaling of coordinates
-coord optimize:   coordinates may be rescaled in order to improve resolution
                   (default)
-coord pixel:      the original pixel coordinate system will be used

--------!-dimension-E-----------------------
-dimension N:      Specifies the maximum extension (in x- or y-direction)
                   of the generated output image. Default: 512 pixels.
                   IMPORTANT: This parameter will only be evaluated, if
                   the input file is of vector type (or 'null').

--------!-xdim-E----------------------------
-xdim N:           Specifies the maximum extension (in x-direction)
                   of the generated (raster) image. Default: original value

--------!-ydim-E----------------------------
-ydim N:           Specifies the maximum extension (in y-direction)
                   of the generated (raster) image. Default: original value

--------!-dither-E--------------------------
-dither off:       Turns dithering off (Default)                         
-dither linear:    Turns dithering on
                   Note: Dithering will only performed, if the output format
                   is a raster format.

--------!-drcolor-E-------------------------
-drcolor <r> <g> <b>: drawing color for plotting user-defined functions
                   (see switch '-function')

--------!-dst-E-----------------------------
-dst dist <N>:     specifies the stitch distance in 0.1 mm               
-dst width <N>:    specifies the line width in 0.1 mm               
-dst fill hollow:  Colored areas will not be filled               
-dst fill hatch:   Generates cross-hatched lines (see hatch1 ...), default               
-dst fill zickzag: Generates zickzag lines                

--------!-dxfopt-E--------------------------
-dxfopt type 2dim: Generates 2-dimensional coordinates (if the output format
                   is DXF. (Default)
-dxfopt type 3dim: Generates 3-dimensional coordinates (if the output format
                   is DXF. 
-dxfopt form unix: adds only <LF> (line feed) at line ends (default)
-dxfopt form dos:  adds <CR> <LF> at line ends 

--------!-fill-E----------------------------
The fill parameters specify how the generated polylines/polygons will be
interpreted:

-fill solid:       Polygons are always closed (i.e. the last point of a
                   vector is identical with the first point). The Polygons
                   are filled with individual colors (DEFAULT). The sort
                   parameter should not be 'min' in this case because the 
                   larger Polygons would cover and hide the smaller ones.

-fill line:        Output consists of polylines with individual colors. The
                   polylines are not closed. This is the preferable fill
                   parameter if the outputfile is generated for a pen-plotter.
                   The plotter pen will never plot more than one color one
                   upon another. The layout will depend on the sort order 
                   specified with the 'sort' switch. With the switches 
                   'reduce' and 'smooth' you can once more refine the layout
                   of the output.
				    
-fill contour:     The same as '-fill solid', however the interiors of the 
                   polygons remain 'hollow'. Lines with different colour
                   can cover each other. The layout will depend on the
                   sort order specified with the 'sort' switch.

--------!-font-E----------------------------
-font:             KVEC generates (before vectorization) an optimized set
                   of parameters, which is suited for vectorization of
                   dark colored text on a clear background. All objects
                   get a unique 'dark' color. Sort order "local" is
                   automatically turned on for generation od sub-polygons.

--------!-format-E--------------------------
The format parameters specify the output format:
(Please note that KVEC can also determine the output format by parsing the
file suffix from the output filename, if you don't specify a output-format)

-format wmf:       Output format is Windows Metafile format, *.WMF                
-format amf:       Output format is ALDUS WMF Metafile  *.WMF
-format emf:       Output format is Enhanced Windows Metafile format, *.EMF
-format ps:        Output format is Postscript level 2, *.PS             
-format eps:       Output format is Encapsulated Postscript level 2, *.EPS                
-format dxf:       Output format is AutoCad DXF, *.DXF              
-format hpgl:      Output format is HPGL, *.HPG or *.PLT             
-format art:       Output format is ART LogoArt (OS/2-graphics program), *.ART
-format ai:        Output format is Adobe Illustrator, *.AI
-format bmp:       Output format is Windows Bitmap, *.BMP
-format tiff:      Output format is Tiff, *.TIF
-format zyxel:     Output format is ZYXEL FAX 
-format pfax:      Output format is PowerFax 
-format kvc:       Output format is KVEC vector format 
-format xfig:      Output format is XFIG vector format (Linux Drawing program) 
-format pcs:       Output format is Pfaff PCS vector format  
-format dst:       Output format is Tajiama stick format  
-format wav:       Output format is WAV  
-format svg:       Output format is SVG (scalable Vector Graphics)
-format svgz:      Output format is SVGZ (compressed scalable Vector Graphics)
-format swf:       Output format is SWF (Flash MX Format, DEFAULT)
                   The Macromedia Flash MX Editor only accepts special
                   settings which can be controlled by the switch 'winding'
-format png:       Output format is PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
-format jpeg:      Output format is JPEG
-format html:	   (only windows version)
                   Please Note: '-format html' is a synonym for the following
                   set of parameters:
                   '-format jpg'  '-hmtl source default','-html screen default', 
                   '-html preview default', '-mode isotrop'

                   This is not a real output format, but a switch for a
                   very special application: Assume you have a lot of 
                   image-files and you want to generate a set of html-files 
                   which allow you to view all these files in a convenient way.
                   Note: This is very useful if you want to post hundreds or
                   thousands of photos in a web site offer a fast way of 
                   viewing. Kvec will generate a seperate html-file for each 
                   individual image. A html-file called "directory.htm" will 
                   also be generated, which refers to the individual html-files
                   by preview images. 
                   Each image will be created in 3 resolutions:
                   low (preview), medium (screen display), and high (download). 
                   Therefore, 3 versions will be created from each image.
                   Assuming a input filename of test01.bmp we will get: 
                   source_test01.jpg, screen_test01.jpg, previe_test01.jpg.
                   The following command will perform the whole procedure 
                   
                   kvec source_dir\test*.bmp destination_dir\*.htm 

                   Assume we have 100 image files of any readable input format: 
                   KVEC will generate 300 jpeg files in the destination 
                   directory. KVEC will also generate 100 html files containing
                   links to the generated image files. 
                   The preview images can be viewed in the file directory.htm
                   which will also be created in the destination directory.

--------!-function-E------------------------
-function ...:     (see also: '-nstep', '-bkcolor', '-drcolor', '-xmin',
                   '-xmax', '-ymin', '-ymax', '-tmin', 'tmax', -lwidth')
                   This switch is not for processing image files.
                   The function switch lets KVEC generate plots of mathematical
                   functions, which can be entered right after the function-
                   keyword. The definition of math. function also includes
                   the definition of user-specified constants. As the definition
                   of functions and variables can be very long, it is not 
                   recommended to enter all this values on the commandline.
                   It is much more practicable to enter all the definitions in
                   a KVEC parameter file.
                   The strings following the '-function' keyword are interpreted
                   as a C-style written definition of up to 8 functions and 
                   100 Variables. The keyword 'endfunc' (without ";") terminates
                   the function definition. Assignments of variables (constants)
                   must precede the definition of functions! Thus, variables can
                   not be initialized with function results.
                   Some restrictions apply:
                   Functions must follow one the following naming conventions:
                   
                   f?(argument)         ('?' can be any alphanumeric char)
                                        (argument can be one of: x,y,z,t,i)
                   x?(argument) y?(argument)       ('?' any alphanumeric char)
                            (parametric representation)
                   r?(phi-argument)   ('?' can be any alphanumeric char)
                            (argument must be: p)
                            (representation in polar-coordinates)
                   Allowed are also x?(), y?() or f?() 
                        (without argument, mainly for iterative functions)
                   Please note: The function names (two chars long) can also be
                   used as variable. This can be useful for initialization in
                   iterative functions or loops.
                   As initialization of constants and variables precede the
                   function definitions, they are 'global' and refer to all
                   (of the max. 8 possible) functions. 
                   
                   Here a few examples: f1(x)=sin(x); fa(t)=cos(t); (allowed)
                                        fabc(x)=x; (not allowed)
                                        f1(x) = cos(x); (not allowed)
                                        f2(x)=SUM(n=1,100,x^n/n!);  (allowed)                   
                                        x3(t)=cos(t); y3(t)=sin(t); (allowed)
                                        y(x)=exp(x);  (not allowed)
                                        x1(i)=KV_PRIMES[i]; y1(i)=i; (allowed)
                                        r1(p)=0.5*p; (allowed)
                   
                   Each statement ends with a ';' Within a statement, no blanks
                   or other white-spaces are allowed. Statements however can be 
                   seperated by any white-space chars.
                   Please note that max. eight different functions are allowed.

                   The function names are two chars long and must start with a 
                   'f', 'x', 'y' or 'r' followed by any alphanumeric char. If 
                   we have a parameter representation (two functions, e.g. 
                   x1(t)=... and y1(t)=...), the x1(t) function must precede the 
                   y1(t) function. A parameter representation counts as one function.
                   If the order of definition is reversed, the result is 
                   unpredictable. The function argument must be one of:
                   'x', 'y', 'z', 't' or 'p' (in case of polar-coordinates). 
                   Expressions can be nested by braces '(', ')'. Constants may 
                   be defined like this (examples):
                   ABC=1.234;  SQ2=1.414; ...
                   Note: Constants may not be defined by expressions.
                   
                   The following operators are allowed:
                   '+' Addition or unitary '+'
                   '-' Subtraction or unitary '-'
                   '*' Multiplication
                   '/' Division
                   '%' Modulus
                   '^' Raising to a power
                   '!' Factorial (can also be applied to expressions)
                   'SUM' Summation. Syntax: SUM(n=<start>,<end>,<func>);
                        e.g.: SUM(n=1,100,x^n/n!);
                   'PROD' Products. Syntax: PROD(n=<start>,<end>,<func>);
                   'ITER' Iteration loops. Syntax: 
                          ITER(n=<start>,<end>,<epsilon>,<f?=init-value>,<func>);
                   'iterate' (more flexible iteration loops.) Syntax: 
                      iterate(n=<start>,<end>,<epsilon>,<(list of var-initializations>);

                   (There can be only one loop-variable in the SUM,PROD or ITER
                   statements, loop-variables must be initialized with constants).
                   The 'ITER' command is intended for simple functions of one
                   variable (e.g. f1(x)=<and expression containing x>). The function
                   term must be definied as the last expression within the ITER() term.
                   The function-term may contain the function name as variable
                   (iteration). The Iteration starts with a loop variable of value
                   <start> and ends when the loop variable is greater or equal than
                   <end> or when the difference between the results of two iterations
                   is less than epsilon. Iteration loops for functions in parameter 
                   representation  (x(t) and y(t) is not possible with the 'ITER'command.
                   For this purpose please use the more general 'iterate()' command.
                   
                   Syntax: 
                   iterate(n=<start>,<end>,<epsilon>,<(list of variable-initializations>);
                   
                   The 'iterate' command does not include the function definition.
                   the function-definition(s) must be defined right after the iterate
                   command. This command can also be used for iterating functions
                   of two variables or functions definied by parameter representation. 
                   The variable definitions/initializations are only valid for the
                   function(s) following the 'iterate' command (not global),

                   Note: Functions can also be definied without function arguments
                   (e.g. x1() = <any term>). The function can also
                   contain the funcion name itself (iteration). The no. of iterations
                   is controled by the nstep parameter (globally by specifying
                   '-nstep <N>' outside of the region definied by '-function' and
                   'endfunc') or individually for each definied function by 'nstep <N>;'
                   within the function region. The actual iteration index can be used
                   within the function by the internal variable 'II'. Please do not
                   assign any values to the variable 'II'.

                   All functions defined in the C-ANSI standard can be used.
                   This covers most of the elementary mathematical functions.
                   The following higher mathematical functions can also be used
                   (at the moment, this set will be expanded):

                   getDigitWithIndI(x) (get digit with index X in decimal expansion)

                   KVEC offers also predefined mathematical constants and variables
                   which can be used (all capital letters):

                   Brackets ('[' and ']') must be used when this predefined
                   arrays ares used (instead of '(' or ')').
                   Please note that indices start with 0, so the first prime
                   is in KV_PRIMES[0].

                   Special commands for getNextDigOfInvI(), getPerLengthOfInvI()

                   Graphical commands can be entered at any postion after the
                   section of the variables definition (please note that
                   there is no '=' char and no leading '-'). These commands
                   must be located between the '-function' and 'endfunc' 
                   keywords.

                   bkcolor r g b;    (set the background color to (rgb) value)

                   imax n;         (set max value for integer function argument) 
                   object <object-type>; (set type of KVEC object)
                          Object-type can be one of (specify without ''):
                          'polyline' (this is the default)
                          'polygon'
                          'markcircle', 'markfilledcircle'
                          'markrect','markfilledrect'
                          'markrbox','markfilledrbox'
                          'hline', 'vline'
                          'polyspline', 'filledpolyspline'

                   msize n;          (set the marker size in % of image size)
                   pmode <mode>:     (set drawing mode for functions with parametric
                                      representation):
                          'normal'   (draw x-y plot, this is the default)
                          'xt'       (draw x-t plot)
                          'yt'       (draw y-t plot)
                          'abs'      (draw absolute value of (x,y) versus t)
                          The xt/yt/abs modes are useful if you want to plot the
                          real/imaginary part (or both) of a complex function in
                          dependence of a parameter t.

                   

                   IMPORTANT: Graphical settings will be applied only for the
                   currently processed (active) user-defined function (except
                   the bkcolor setting). They can be specified individually for
                   eych user-defined function. If not specified, default-values
                   will be applied. Graphical settings must precede the function
                   definition. Using 'polyline' or 'polygon' will result in
                   continuously drawn lines between the points with the given
                   spacing (see nstep). Using markers will set marker symbols
                   (circles, rectangle or line segments) at the plotting 
                   positions without drawing lines between them.
                   IMPORTANT: The size of these marker symbols depends on the
                   'plot-history' of all drawn objects. Thus, plotting markers 
                   should be the last plotting action (after all other functions
                   have been plotted).

                   When using SVG or SWF format, the output size and dimensions
                   should be controled with the following switches:

                   The plotted values (x,y) can be printed to the specifified
                   output device be setting: '-debug plot'

--------!-gapfill-E-------------------------
-gapfill N:        This parameter controls whether the vectorizer can 'jump'
                   over gaps while tracing an object. The value N must be
                   specified in 10ths of a pixel. Allowed values: 0 - 30.

--------!-grit-E----------------------------
-grit N:           Polylines or polygons which belong to a bounded area with
                   a number of pixels fewer than N will be filtered out (i.e.
                   small details are 'erased'). The default value depends on
                   the dimensions and the colour depth of the picture. The
                   use of a grit value > 0 increases the computing time
                   and increases also considerably the demand of memory.
                   If you have to deal economically with memory you should
                   try a grit value of 0 and decrease the quantization value.

--------!-hatch-E---------------------------
The hatching parameters will only be evaluated if the output format is
DXF, PCS, DST or HPGL.

-hatch1 density N: The max. number of horizontal hatch lines will be limited
                   to N (use 0 in order to turn off hatching)
-hatch2 density N: The max. number of vertical hatch lines will be limited
                   to N (use 0 in order to turn off hatching)
-hatch1 angle N:   hatch angle for horizontal hatch lines (Default: 40 deg.)
-hatch2 angle N:   hatch angle for vertical hatch lines (Default: 40 deg.)

--------!-html-E----------------------------
The html parameters specify how to build additional html files which contain 
links to the generated output images. (See also: '-format html')

-html source none: No conversion to high-resolution version (source 
                   resolution) will take place. Individual html files will 
                   not contain links to high resolution images.
-html source original: A copy of the original image file (renamed to 
                   source_xxx..) will be created in the destination 
                   directory. Individual html-files will contain download-
                   links to them.
-html source format: Conversion and creation of high resolution files by
                   applying all parameters and output format. The files 
                   will be created in the destination directory. Individual 
                   html files will contain download links to them.
-html source default: (the same as 'format'). However: A copy (instead of 
                   conversion) will be created, if source and destination 
                   format are equal.
                   If the dimensions of the source image file are 
                   dimx <=800 and dimy <= 600, no high resolution file will 
                   generated and no download link in the html file.

-html screen none: No conversion to screen-resolution version and no 
                   embedding in the corresponding html file.
-html screen original: A copy of the original image file (renamed to 
                   'screen_xxx..")
                   will be created in the destination directory. Images 
                   will embedded in the corresponding html-files.
-html screen format: Conversion and creation of screen resolution files by
                   applying all parameters and output format. The files will
                   be created in the destination directory. These images
                   will be embedded in the corresponding html-files.
-html screen default: (the same as 'format'). However: Only format-parameter
                   will be applied and resampling to 800*600 pixel (isotrop).


-html preview none: No conversion to preview-resolution version. 
                   'directory.htm'will not be created. 
-html preview original: A copy of the original image file (renamed to 
                   'previe_xxx..") will be created in the destination 
                   directory. Images will embedded in the files 
                   'directory.htm'.
-html preview format: Conversion and creation of preview resolution files by
                   applying all parameters and output format. The files will
                   be created in the destination directory. These images
                   will be embedded in the file 'directory.htm'.
-html preview default: (the same as 'format'). However: output-format is
                   'JPEG' and resampling to 60*60 pixel (isotrop).

--------!-jpg-E-----------------------------
-jpg quality <N>:  Selects the quality for the JPEG output format.
                   Allowed values: 1-100 (Default: 75)
-jpg grayscale on: Selects gray output for JPEG output images
-jpg grayscale off: colored output for JPEG output images (Default)
    
--------!-justify-E-------------------------
The justify parameters will only be evaluated if input and output formats
are both raster type. The color depth of the input file can be 1 -24 bit.
The main application for these options is justifying and cleaning
binary (B/W) scanned images in order to embed them into documents.
The default justify parameters are optimized for justifying and cleaning
DIN A4 images (300 dpi) containing text.
Carbon copies often have dirty black margins or are slightly distorted
by an small angle because the source got out of place while copying.
KVEC can automatically correct these errors, if you choose a proper set
of justify parameters.

-justify type off:   No justification will be performed (default).
-justify type rotate:Justification will be performed only by rotation     
-justify type all:   Justification will be performed by rotation and cleaning
                     (cutting off) the dirty margins.
-justify type angle: No justification will be performed, only determination
                     of the rotation angle
-justify phimax N:   maximal allowed rotation angle. This is the max.
                     distortion angle which can be corrected. Please note
                     that the computional time increases linear with the
                     size of phimax. Default: 5.0 degrees
-justify parameter N1 N2 N3:
                     These values control the operation of the internal
                     algorithms (detecting large rectangular blocks from 
                     which the rotation angle is deducted)
                     N1: 'thicking' factor. Each pixel will be enlarged by
                         this factor in order to make block structures
                         more detectable. Default: 16
                     N2: min. filter value. Regions with a coherent no. of
                         pixels less than N2 will be eliminated before the
                         internal block detection algorithm starts.
                         Default: 50
                     N3  max. filter value. Regions with a coherent no. of
                         pixels greater than N2 will be eliminated before the
                         internal block detection algorithm starts.
                         Default: 400
                     Note: The default parameter values are optimized for a
                     DIN A4 image (300 dpi resol.) containing an average text.
                     (the average size of charcters lies within the range
                     50 up to 1000 pixels for a character).
                     This will ensure that only those parts of the image
                     which contain text information are relevant for the
                     computation of the rotation angle.

                     For other types of B/W images (electronic circuits or
                     plans) other values for N1, N2 and N3 may work better.
-justify fill ...:   margins and edges generated by rotation will be filled
-justify fill black: with black color (or the 'nearest' black color)
-justify fill white: with white color (or the 'nearest' white color), DEFAULT
-justify fill user <R> <G> <B>: with a user-supplied color
-justify preserve off: output image can have dimensions different from input
-justify preserve on: output image has the same dimensions as input

--------!-kvc-E-----------------------------
-kvc compress none: Disables any compression for the KVC Vector format     
-kvc compress lzw: Applies the LZW compression technique to the KVC format
                   (lzw is the default compression)
-kvc bufsize <N>:  Specifies the size of the packets which were compressed
-kvc byteorder i:  Selects the INTEL byteorder for the binary data (Default)
-kvc byteorder m:  Selects the MOTOROLA byteorder for the binary data

--------!-language-E------------------------
                   (GUI-Parameter) specifies the language for the KVEC-GUI.
                   Note: the commandline version ignores GUI parameters. 
-language default: Uses the precompiled setting.
-language english: English language
-language german:  German language
-language czech:   Czech language

--------!-lwidth-E--------------------------
-lwidth:           Specifies the line width of the generated output vectors
                   in 10ths of a pixel.
                   Allowed values: 0-1000. Default value: 0.
                   Note that this parameter has a different meaning if
                   used together with the option -centerline.
                   In this case the default value for the lwidth is 100.

--------!-maxpoints-E-----------------------
-maxpoints:        Specifies the max. no. of points which are allowed for
                   the generated polylines or polygons. This is useful if
                   KVEC produces vectors with more than 32767 points and
                   you use the WMF output format (WMF does not support
                   polylines with more than 32767 points)

--------!-mode-E----------------------------
-mode iso:         Select isotropic mode. This mode preserves the the X/Y ratio
                   of the picture. (A circle will also be a circle in the
                   output picture). This is the default setting.
                   (PostScript, AI, SWF and SVG format and 
                   vector-raster conversion only)

-mode aniso:       Select anisotropic mode. The picture will be scaled to fit
                   the whole papersize according to the selected paperformat.
                   (PostScript, AI, SWF and SCG format and 
                   vector-raster conversion only)
--------!-monitor-E-------------------------
-monitor:          Turn on progress monitor. Information about the current
                   status and the progress of the program will be displayed.

--------!-nstep-E---------------------------
-nstep:            Set no. of steps (interpolation points) for user defined
                   function (see switch '-function')
--------!-overlapp-E------------------------
-overlap:          If this switch is specified, Polygons will slightly 
                   overlap, actually one pixel. (DEFAULT: no overlap).
                   If vector images show strange coloured gaps after they 
                   have been rotated (especially along border lines between 
                   adjacent Polygons) you should set this switch.

--------!-palette-E-------------------------
-palette optimize: KVEC will use internal optimzed palette when color
                   reducing has to be done (default)
-palette fixed:    KVEC will use a standard color palette when color
                   reducing has to be done. This often gives better vectorization
                   reults, especially if the raster image contains less than 16 colors.
-palette user <n>  R1,G1,B1, .... Rn,Gn,Bn:
                   Here you can specify a user supplied color palette which
                   contains <n> colors. The value <n> must be followed by
                   <n> RGB triples. It is more practicable to use a parameter
                   file than entering all RGB values on the commandline.
                   The value for n may not exceed 256 colors.
--------!-paper-E---------------------------
-paper (format):   Select papersize. Currently this option controls the
                   output size for the following formats:
                   PostScript, Adobe Illustrator, SVG and SWF.
                   The format-string must be one of the following:

                   'user' width height  (width and height in mm)
                   (the size of SVG or SWF graphic can be specified this way)

--------!-pattern-E-------------------------
This parameter applies only to vector objects and is therefore without effect
for a pure raster-to-raster format conversion.
The last three parameters DR, DG and DB specify the max. color differences  
used for color shading or random color patterns. Allowed values: 0 up to 255.
-pattern nodither   D1 D2 D3: No color shading (default)       
-pattern left2right D1 D2 D3: Color shading from left to right 
-pattern right2left D1 D2 D3: Color shading from right to left 
-pattern top2bottom D1 D2 D3: Color shading from top to bottom
-pattern bottom2top D1 D2 D3: Color shading from bottom to top
-pattern inout      D1 D2 D3: Color shading from inside to outside
-pattern outin      D1 D2 D3: Color shading from outside to inside
-pattern randrgb    D1 D2 D3: Random color dithering

Important: Please note, that the specified vector output format must support
color shading. Currently only the KVC and ART format support color shading.
Color shading will always be done if you choose a raster output format and
your input file has a vector format.

--------!-png-E-----------------------------
The png-parameters will only be evaluated if the output format is the
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format:

-png bitdepth <N>: Bitdepth of the PNG image. Allowed values: 1,4,8,24
                   Palette images can only have up to 8 bits, RGB only 24 bit.
                   Default: 24 Bit
-png coltype gray: generates a gray scaled image
-png coltype pal:  generates a palette image
-png coltype rgb:  generates a RGB image with 24 bit bitdepth
-png coltype alpha2: generates gray image with  alpha channel (not yet implemented) 
-png coltype alpha4: generates RGB image with alpha channel  
                   Default: rgb
-png tcolor <R> <G> <B>: Selects a transparency color 
                   Default: no transparency color
-png interlace:    turns on interlacing (not yet implemented)
                   Default: No interlacing
-png gamma <N>:    specifies the gamma value Default: 0.45
                   Please enter integer number. 100000 corresponds to a value 1.0
-png addpalette:   adds a palette to RGB (true color) images (not implemented)
                   Default: PNG file contains palette only for palette images
-png bkcolor <R> <G> <B>: specifies a background color for the PNG image
                   Default: no background color
-png ppx <N>:      sets the value for pixels per unit in x-direction
-png ppy <N>:      sets the value for pixels per unit in y-direction
-png pixunit meter: selects the unit as 1 meter.
-png pixunit none:  selects the unit as unknown (Default)

KVEC gets the bitdepth and the color type from the input file and uses default
values for the png parameters if none of them are specified.
In the case of vector-format to PNG conversion KVEC tries to use the highest possible
bitdepth. This will be normally 24 bit unless another value is specified.        

--------!-primes-E--------------------------
-primes <N>:       Initialize internal primenumber array up to N
                   (Default, if not specified: 1000000)

--------!-quantize-E------------------------
-quantize <N>:     The input file will be quantized down to N colors before
                   vectorization, if it contains more than N colours.
                   (Default: 32 colours).
                   For DXF and HPGL the default is 8 colors.

--------!-reduce-E--------------------------
The reduce parameters specify whether all those points of a vector laying on a 
straight line may be replaced (= reduced) by two points (the start and the end 
point of the straight line). This reduces the size of the outputfile. 
Because straight lines can lie horizontally, vertically, or diagonally,
we have:
 
-reduce orthogonal:straight horizontal and vertical line-segments will be
                   reduced. This is the default value.
-reduce all:       All straight lines will be reduced (diagonal lines too).
                   Occasionally, small gaps may appear in the layout.
-reduce off:       lines will not be reduced. The only case in which you may
                   want this setting is when you want the velocity of a
                   plotter pen to slow down for long straight lines.

--------!-resolution-E----------------------
The resolution parameters have some influence on the internal evaluation:

-resolution low:   very small details may get lost (default)
-resolution high:  all details will be retained (needs more memory)

--------!-rotate-E--------------------------
-rotate N:         Set rotation angle (value N in degrees)
                   Rotation will only be performed if the command list
                   specified by the -process switch contains a 'rotate'
                   command. The default rotation angle is 40 degrees.
                   Note: Only input raster files are concerned from rotation.
                   Rotation takes places before any vectorization.

--------!-scale-E---------------------------
The scaling parameters will obly be evaluated if the output format is
DXF or HPGL.

-scale hpgl N:     The output HPGL image will be scaled by a factor of N
-scale dxf N:      The output DXF image will be scaled by a factor of N
                   See also -xyscale hpgl / -xyscale dxf
                   IMPORTANT: scale dxf can also be used to scale SWF output
--------!-sort-E----------------------------
The sort parameters specify the sequence order in which the vectors appear in
the outputfile:

-sort nosort:      Vectors will not be sorted. Contours with different colours
                   may cover each other but the interior areas of each
                   vector cannot be covered by those of another vector.

-sort max:         This parameter depends on the filltype: For filltype
                   'solid' the Polygons are sorted by the size of the bounded 
                   area. For filltype line and color they are sorted by
                   the length of the vectors (sortorder is from maximimum to
                   minimum). This is the default value.

-sort min:         The same as sort 'max' but sortorder is from minimum to
                   maximum. This makes no sense together with '-fill solid'.

-sort local:       The generated output order preserves the local topology,
                   i.e. objects are drawn in the order in which they are
                   nested. The sort order in a group of nested objects is
                   from max to min. The sort order for groups is the same.
                   Needs more computing time.
                   If the sort order is local0, KVEC will try to generate
                   subpolygons having transparency color. This may be usefull
                   for vectorizing of text. The "-font" option will turn on
                   the local sort order automatically.

-sort color:       Polygons/polylines are sorted by color. You may want this
                   setting for HPGL output.

--------!-subsampling-E---------------------
-subsampling:      The output vectors are subsampled by a factor of 2. This
                   will reduce the size of the output file and will also
                   result in smoothing the vectors. 

--------!-sysmalloc-E-----------------------
-sysmalloc on:     (Default) Uses the memory-allocation routines from the
                   operating system
-sysmalloc off:    KVEC uses its own memory allocation routines. Some
                   operating systems have slow allocation routines. Try this
                   switch if the performance of KVEC decreases.

--------!-tcolor-E--------------------------
The transparency parameters will only be evaluated if the output format is
a format which can handle filled objects.
The transparency color will be suppressed in the generated output image.
Some formats cannot handle subpolygons. For these formats the transparency
option will not work correctly in some cases.
Default: Transparency option is turned off.

-tcolor auto:      Autodedect transparency color
-tcolor color R G B: User-defined transparency color (RGB values)

--------!-text-E----------------------------
-text on/off:      Generate or suppress output of text in the output file.
                   This applies only to formats which support text objects.
                   Default: -text on

--------!-tiff-E----------------------------
The Tiff-parameters will only be evaluated if the output format is the
Tiff or PowerFax format and control the generation of the Tiff-file:

-tiff append:   The image will be appended as subimage (Default: overwrite)
-tiff FillOrder msb2lsb: (for bilevel Fax images) Default
-tiff FillOrder lsb2msb: (for bilevel Fax images)
-tiff byteorder I:   byte-order in the Tiff file will be 'INTEL' (DEFAULT)
-tiff byteorder M:   byte-order in the Tiff file will be 'MOTOROLA'
-tiff compress none: no compression will be performed (DEFAULT)
-tiff compress huffman: 'Huffman-compression' will be used (bilevel images)
-tiff compress fax3: Fax group3 compression will be used (bilevel images)
-tiff compress fax4: Fax group4 compression will be used (bilevel images)
-tiff compress lzw:  LZW compression will be used 
-tiff compress packbits: 'packbits-compression' will be used  
-tiff Group3Opt fill: insert fillbits before EOL (Fax only)
-tiff xres <N>:   Xresolution in pixels per inch (Default: 300)
-tiff yres <N>:   Yresolution in pixels per inch (Default: 300)
-tiff SubFileType normal: (Default)
-tiff SubFileType mask: Transparency mask
-tiff SubfileType page: multi page file (fax)
-tiff predictor:   The Tiff-predictor field is set to 2 (for LZW compression)
                   DEFAULT: predictor field not set.
-tiff photo white:   Photometric interpretation: 'MINISWHITE'
                     Tiff file will be of type 'bilevel' or 'grayscale'
                     (tiff class 'B' or 'G')
-tiff photo black:   Photometric interpretation: 'MINISBLACK'
                     Tiff file will be of type 'bilevel' or 'grayscale'
                     (tiff class 'B' or 'G')
-tiff photo rgb:     Tiff file will have 3 color components (RGB)
                     (tiff class 'R') (DEFAULT setting)
-tiff photo separated: Tiff file will have 4 color components (CMYK)

                     (tiff class 'P')
-tiff photo ycbcr:   Tiff file will have luminance and chrominance components 
                     (tiff class 'Y')
-tiff stripsize N:   Tiff file will have a stripsize of N Bytes 
                     Default: 32000 Bytes.

--------!-trim-E----------------------------
-trim:             Trim picture. (Only WMF output format)

--------!-xmin-E----------------------------
-xmin <x>:         set x-range for plotting user-defined functions
                   (in arbitrary units)
                   (see switch '-function')

--------!-xmax-E----------------------------
-xmax <x>:         set x-range for plotting user-defined functions
                   (in arbitrary units)
                   (see switch '-function')

--------!-ymin-E----------------------------
-ymin <y>:         set y-range for plotting user-defined functions
                   (in arbitrary units)
                   (see switch '-function')

--------!-ymax-E----------------------------
-ymax <y>:         set y-range for plotting user-defined functions
                   (in arbitrary units)
                   (see switch '-function')

--------!-zmin-E----------------------------
-zmin <z>:         set z-range for plotting user-defined functions
                   (in arbitrary units)
                   (see switch '-function')

--------!-zmax-E----------------------------
-zmax <z>:         set z-range for plotting user-defined functions
                   (in arbitrary units)
                   (see switch '-function')

--------!-tmin-E----------------------------
-tmin <t>:         set t-range for plotting user-defined functions
                   (in arbitrary units)
                   (see switch '-function')

--------!-tmax-E----------------------------
-tmax <t>:         set t-range for plotting user-defined functions
                   (in arbitrary units)
                   (see switch '-function')

--------!-phimin-E--------------------------
-phimin <phi>:     set phi-range for plotting user-defined functions
                   (in polar-coordinate units)
                   (see switch '-function')

--------!-phimin-E--------------------------
-phimax <phi>:     set phi-range for plotting user-defined functions
                   (in polar-coordinate units)
                   (see switch '-function')

--------!-vblack-E--------------------------
-vblack:           Only the colors with the 'darkest' RGB-values will be
                   vectorized (picks the 'black' lines out of the picture).
                   All other objects were treated as having one unique
                   'white color'. The regions consisting of this 'white'
                   color will also be vectorized. Thus, white areas inside
                   of black areas will be shown correctly.
                   Note that a lower -quantize value results in the
                   generation of more 'black' lines. If the quantize
                   value is too high, the program will not catch all all
                   dark regions.

--------!-voblack-E-------------------------
-voblack dark:     The same as -vblack, except that only the dark areas
                   will be processed. Thus, white areas inside of black
                   areas might dissapear if the 'black' object is of type
                   'filled polygon'.
-voblack nwhite:   The same as -vblack, except that only 'not white' areas
                   will be processed. Thus, white areas inside of other
                   areas might dissapear if the object is of type
                   'filled polygon'.

--------!-viewtype-E------------------------
                   (GUI-Parameter) specifies the viewer for the KVEC-GUI.
                   Note: the commandline version ignores GUI parameters. 
-viewtype SWF:     (default) Macromedia Shockwave (Flash) 
-viewtype SVG:     Adobe SVG Format (Scalable vector graphics) 


--------!-winding-E-------------------------
-winding original: (Default) Winding of polygons will be unchanged, as
                   detected from the source or from the vectorizer.
-winding reversed: Reverse the winding direction. This may be necessary
                   for some types of input data. 
-winding optimized: KVEC sets alternating winding directions for main-
                   and subpolygons, depending on the nesting depth.

                   The winding settings are only relevant for the SWF 
                   format (and especially if you want to import the
                   SWF files into the Macromedia Flash Editor). The
                   Flash Players can handle all types of winding directions

The following switches are only available for registered users:

The Debug switches specify the level of the debug-output. The debug-output
with informations about the status of the vectorization process is displayed
on the screen. (High level means more detailed debug output).

--------!-debug-E---------------------------
-debug N:          Generate debug-output level N (1-8) (default: No debug)
-debug all:        Generate very detailed debug-output

--------!-delta-E---------------------------
-delta N:          This is the maximal allowed color difference between the
                   rough and the detail layer. The detail layer contains
                   a vector representation of these areas which have a colour
                   difference to the first layer greater than delta.
                   Note: delta has two different meanings: If used together
                   with the 'progressive' option it means a color difference
                   between two layers. If used together with the 'vcolor'
                   option it means a maximal allowed color tolerance.
                   Values: 0 up to 128. Default: 0

--------!-errbez-E--------------------------
-errbez N:         Use the value N for the Bezier error-parameter.
                   Allowed values: 1 - 20. Greater values for errbez will
                   allow more differences between the original and the
                   output picture and will reduce the size of the output.
		   The default value is 3.

--------!-group-E---------------------------
-group:            Generates recursively nested groups of objects
                   This parameter applies for the LogoArt format only.

--------!-lossless-E------------------------
-lossless:         Generates a lossless image. May need enormous memory.
                   This is a synonym for:
                   -resolution high -grit 0 -reduce orth. and no quantization

--------!-process-E-------------------------
-process <list>    KVEC has built in some image processing features which
                   are hardly to be found in other graphic programs.
                   You can specify a list of instructions after the
                   'process' keyword. These instructions must be entered
                   as strings or as ordinal numbers and must be seperated by
                   one of the following characters: ',',':','.','-'.
                   The 'string-keywords may be abbreviated.
                   The instructions were performed as soon as the image is
                   read from disk (or automatically generated by using the
                   '-random' switch). Here a few examples:

(Apply Gauss Highpass filter)

KVEC null y.tif -for tif -proc norm_flo,fft_bm,spect_2_f,ifft_bm,norm_byt -random 24 2
KVEC null y.tif -for tif -proc 11,14,23,15,8 -random 24 2



                   The (first) instruction 'byte2complex' and the (last)
                   instruction 'complex2byte' need not to be specified, 
                   KVEC executes them by default.
                   Example 2 (Spectrum):
                   This instructs KVEC to perform a fourier transformation
                   with the image, apply the log() function to it, normalize
                   the values to the range [0..255], put the origin of the
                   image into the center (which is the better choice for
                   frequency representations). After this KVEC continues
                   in evaluating the other switches.

                   PLEASE NOTE THAT THE BITMAP MUST BE CONVERTED TO A COMPLEX
                   BITMAP. THIS MAY RESULT IN ENORMOUS MEMORY DEMANDS!
                   Here an example: If we have a 500 * 500 bitmap with a
                   colordepth of 4 bit (palette bitmap), the bitmap occupies
                   500*500*1/2 * sizeof(BYTE) =  125 KByte. The converted
                   complex bitmap occupies
                   500*500*(3 colorplanes)*sizeof(COMPLEX) = 6 MByte.
                   Here are the keywords and the ordinal numbers (some of
                   the functions may not yet be implemented).
                   Please type the keywords lowercase in the commandline.
                   instruction: ordinal number:

GRAY2COLOR: The colordepth of the generated colored image (default: 8 Bit)
            can be specified by using the switch '-random <coldepth> <N>.
            The parameter value <N> will be ignored.

--------!-progressive-E---------------------
KVEC offers you the possibility of building a 'progressive' image.
The term 'progressive' means that the image is build up from two successive
layers (one 'rough' picture without details and one refined picture which
contains only details). The two layers follow in this order as the image is 
build up. This kind of image representation is very robust against all kinds
of transformations and local deformations.  The difference of the two layers
with respect to colour quantization and resolution of details is expressed 
by the gritfactor and the colorfactor:


-progressive gritfactor N:   Generates a progressive image with 2 Layers
                             The first layer has a grit-value multiplied by N
-progressive colorfactor N:  Generates a progressive image with 2 Layers
                             The first layer has a quantize-value divided by N

--------!-random-E--------------------------
-random N1 N2:     Generates a random test image for input. The name of the
                   input file should be 'null' or 'vnull' in this case. The
                   parameter N1 specifies the color depth of the test image.
                   Allowed values: 1,4,8,24.
                   N2 specifies the type of the image.

                   Allowed values for N2 for raster images ('null'):
                   0 or 1 (White noise BW or gray), 2 (white noise colored)
                          Values 0,1, or 2 are not suited for vectorization.
                   3 : generates an image of a well known logo... (Default)
                   4 : generates an image of a space shuttle
                   5 : generates an image having 16777216 different colors

                   Allowed values for N2 for vector images ('vnull'):
                   0: Random polylines, 1: random polygons
                   2: random dots
                   3: generates an image (butterfly)... (Default)
                   4: generates an image (tiger)
                   700: Perrin series (set debug outputlevel 8)
                   701: Plot Zetafunction along critcal line
                   702: Plot Zetafunction for real values
                   703: Plot Gammafunction for real values
                   704, 705, 706: ???
                   708: Plot Sigma function (R4)
                   709, 710: ???
                    
--------!-scmode-E--------------------------
                   (GUI-Parameter) specifies the scaling mode.
                   Note: Will be ignored by the commanline version 
-scmode N:         0: isotrop, 1: isotrop, 2: anisotrop, 3: no scaling

--------!-smooth-E--------------------------
-smooth on:        Smooth polylines: the program will try to smoothen the
                   polylines and Polygons. This is involving some loss of
                   information.
                   Default: Depends on the output format.
                   Using the 'smooth on' with the WMF or EMF-Format will
                   increase the resolution of the outputfile by a factor
                   of 4.
                   
-smooth off:       Turns smoothing off

--------!-subimage-E------------------------
-subimage N:       Use subimage No. N in inputfile (Tiff or FAX formats)
                   The first subimage has no. 0. If subimage is not specified
                   KVEC will put all subimages together in one image
                   (for FAX format only)

--------!-swf-E-----------------------------
-swf format mx:    Flash format MX (Default. Writes compressed output)
-swf format 6:     Flash format MX (writes compressed output)
-swf format 5:     Flash format 5.x (uncompressed, for compatibility)
-swf compression zlib: Use zlib compression method (Default, for format mx)
-swf compression none: no compression

--------!-xyscale-E-------------------------
KVEC offers the possibility of anisotropic scaling / translation for
DXF and HPGL output:
-xyscale hpgl X Y: Scale hpgl output with factors X (x-direction) and
                   Y (y-direction)
-xyscale dxf X Y:  Scale dxf output with factors X (x-direction) and
                   Y (y-direction)
-xyoffset X Y:     Add X and Y offset to the coordinates on output
                   (The switch -coord should be set to 'pixel' in this case)

--------!-vcolor-E--------------------------
-vcolor R G B:     This switch can be be used to pick out regions of the
                   image which have the specified color. 
                   The color representation is RGB (Red Green Blue) with
                   values from 0 up to 255.
                   Only these regions that match this colour will be
                   vectorized.
                   Note: If a delta value > 0 is specified ('-delta' option)
                   all colors which lie in the range (RGB +/- delta) will
                   be vectorized.
-vcolor -R -G -B:  Only these regions that do not match this colour will be
                   vectorized.
                   Note: If a delta value > 0 is specified ('-delta' option)
                   all colors which lie in the range (RGB +/- delta) will
                   not be vectorized.

--------!-zlib-E----------------------------
-zlib bufsize <N>: Buffersize for the zlib input/output buffers. Default: 32768
-zlib clevel <N>:  Compression level for the zlib routines (Default: 6)

--------!-ABOUT_KVEC-G----------------------
Was ist KVEC?

KVEC ist ein Freeware-Programm, mit dem Sie Raster-Graphiken in Vektor-
Graphiken konvertieren koennen. Sie koennen es ohne Einschraenkungen benutzen. 
Vor dem Jahr 2010 wurde KVEC als shareware vermatktet. Die freeware version
ist als Download auf der KVEC Internet Seite erhltlich.
Dieses  Version darf frei weitergegeben und kopiert werden.

KVEC ist ein Programm, das hohe Anforderungen an den Speicherbedarf stellt.
Vektorisierung ist ein rechenaufwendiger, komplizierter Prozess und fuehrt
oft zu einem Abwaegen zwischen Rechenzeit und Speicherbedarf.
Es ist entscheidend fuer die Performance, dass Ihr Computer mit genuegend
RAM-Speicher ausgestattet ist. 
Die Auswahl der Werte fuer die (optionalen) Programmparameter erfordert
einige Vorsicht. 'Verrauschte' Bilder (typisch fuer gescannte Farbbilder)
oder Bilder mit sehr vielen sehr kleinen Details sollten mit groesseren
'grit' Werten und kleineren 'quantize' Werten (Erklaerung s. unten) 
ausgewertet werden.

Die Ausgabeformate DXF und HPGL sind nicht fuer die Vektorisierung von 
farbigen Photos oder gescannten Farbbildern geeignet (ausser Sie haben viele 
GBytes Speicher auf Ihrer Festplatte uebrig ;-)  die Groesse der Ausgabe-
Datei waere riesig.

Vektordarstellungen von Bildern haben gegenueber Rastergrafiken mehrere 
Vorteile: Operationen, wie z.B. Rotation, Dehnen, Morphing und Warping sind
viel leichter durchzufuehren und unerwuenschte Effekte wie z. B. Aliasing
tauchen bei Vektor-Bildern erst gar nicht auf. Die Anwendungsgebiete eines
guten Vektorisierers reichen von der Bewegungsschaetzung in Video-Sequenzen
bis hin zur effektiven Bildkompression.

Bitte wenden Sie sich an den Autor, wenn Sie Probleme mit dem Programm haben,
oder wenn Sie Fehler finden.
KVEC wurde so konzipiert, dass es auf mehreren Betriebssystemen (die 
unterschiedliche Hardware und graphische Oberflaechen besitzen) laeuft.
Diese 'Release' ist deshalb eine (graphik-unabhaengige) Kommandozeilen-Version.

Die Syntax ist sehr einfach:

     KVEC (Inputdatei) (Outputdatei) [optionale Parameter]
     Zum Beispiel:
     KVEC test.bmp test.dxf -format dxf

Verschachtelte Unterverzeichnisse werden bei der Anwendung von Wildcards nicht erfasst.
Wenn der Name der Input Datei Wildcards enthlt, weden die Ausgabe-Dateinamen
aus den expandierten Input-Dateinamen abgeleitet und bekommen andere Dateiendungen.
Im Falle identischer Dateinamen fuegt KVEC am Anfang des Dateinames ein '_' 
(Underscore) hinzu um ein Ueberschreiben der Dateien zu verhindern.  Die Dateinamen 
von Input- und Output-Dateien koennen vollstaendige Pfadangaben enthalten.

Man kann KVEC auch mit Hilfe einer Parameter-Datei starten (KVEC.PAR):

KVEC -readpar Parameterdatei

Der Name der Parameter-Datei muss KVEC.PAR lauten (grossgeschrieben), falls
der (optionale) Name der Parameterdatei weggelassen wird.
Bitte beachten: Die letzte Zeile einer Parameter-Datei sollte mit einem
CR oder einem LF Zeichen beendet werden (die Datei wird sonst unter Linux oder 
MAC-OS nicht richtig gelesen).

Die Beispiele von Parameter-Dateien aus dem KVEC Paket koennen benutzt
werden.

--------!-sequence-G------------------------
Seit der Version 3.90 kann KVEC durch die Angabe zweier Parameter-Dateien im 
'Sequenz-Modus' gestartet werden (der letzte Parameter 'nseq' ist optional). 

     KVEC -readpar Parameterdatei1 Parameterdatei2  <nseq>

KVEC wird dann eine Sequenz von <nseq+1> Einzelbildern erzeugen in dem stufenweise
alle Parameterwerte aus der ersten Datei in die Werte aus der zweiten Datei
interpoliert werden. Falls kein Wert fuer 'nseq' angegeben wird, gilt der
Default wert nseq = 100.
Wichtig: Die Eingabe/Ausgabe Dateinamen in der ersten Parameterdatei muessen mit
denen der zweiten Parameterdatei identisch sein. 'vnull' oder 'null' (siehe unten)
in Verbindung mit den internen 'Zufalls' und Demo-Bildern ist auch erlaubt.
Die erzeugten Ausgabedateien haben Indizes (6 Stellen). Existierende Dateien
werden ohne Abfrage ueberschrieben.
Man kann anschliessend andere Konvertierungssoftware dazu hernehmen um aus den
Bild-Sequenzen eine einzige Video-Datei zu erstellen und damit interessante
Animationen (z. Bsp. animierte Funktions-Zeichnungen) erstellen.
Zukuenftige KVEC-Versionen werden die Funktion von echtem 'Morphing' beinhalten, so
dass in beiden Parameterdateien unterschiedliche Inputdateien angegeben werden
koennen.

--------!-intro_in-G------------------------
Inputdatei ist der Name der Rastergraphik-Datei (Tiff, BMP, PCX, TGA, SGI,
IMG, PNM, JPEG, GIF, WPG, PNG oder FAX).
Falls der Name der Input-Datei 'null' lautet, erzeugt KVEC automatisch ein
Zufalls-Testbild (Raster-Bild).
Beim Plotten von benutzer-definierten Funktionen (siehe switch '-function')
muss der Input-Name auch 'vnull' lauten;

Die Eigenschaften dieses Testbildes haengen von den Einstellungen des
Parameters 'random' ab.

--------!-intro_out-G-----------------------
Outputdatei ist der Name der gewuenschten Vektorgraphik-Datei.
Bitte beachten Sie, dass der Dateiname auch das entsprechende File-Suffix
(z.B. WMF) enthalten muss.

Wichtig:
Wenn die Input-Datei bereits ein Vektor-Format hat (WMF oder ART), dann
haben die meisten Eingabeparameter keine Wirkung. In diesem Fall fuehrt
KVEC nur eine Formatumwandlung vom einen Vektorformat ins andere durch.


Z. Zeit werden folgende Vektor-Formate unterstuetzt: 
    - Windows Metafile, Postscript, AutoCad DXF, HPGL, ART, XFIG, PCS, SVG,
      SWF (Flash 6.x), Editable Adobe Illustrator Format, KVEC-Format (KVC).
      DST (Tajiama stick format), HTML

Die Parameter sind optional. Wenn Sie keine Parameter angeben, waehlt das
Programm automatisch einen Satz von Parametern aus, der optimal an die
Eigenschaften der Input-Datei angepasst ist. Die Schluesselwoerter fuer die
Parameter koennen abgekuerzt werden.
Die Dateinamen muessen in der Kommandozeile vor den optionalen Parametern
erscheinen. Einige Parameter koennen jedoch ohne Dateinamen direkt hinter 
KVEC angegeben werden. Von diesen Parametern darf jeweils nur einer angegeben 
werden:

--------!-ehelp-G---------------------------
KVEC -ehelp <thema> Zeigt Hilfe zum Parameter <thema> an (in Enlisch) 

--------!-ghelp-G---------------------------
KVEC -ghelp <thema> Zeigt Hilfe zum Parameter <thema> an (in Deutsch)

--------!-info-G----------------------------
KVEC -info:        Gibt ein paar nuetzliche Informationen auf dem Bildschirm
                   aus.        

--------!-printform-G-----------------------
KVEC -printform:   Erzeugt automatisch ein Registrierungsformular. Dieses
                   Formular koennen Sie per FAX, E-Mail oder Briefpost an
                   den Programm-Autor senden, um einen Registrierungs-
                   schluessel zu erhalten. Der Registrierungsschluessel ist
                   eine max. 5-stellige Zahl, die dem Benutzer erlaubt, die
                   Software zu registrieren und den Zugriff auf die
                   erweiterten Funktionen von KVEC freigibt.
                   Sie koennen eine Sprache auswaehlen. Das Registrierungs-
                   formular wird dann in einer Sprache Ihrer Wahl erzeugt.
                   Das Registrierungsformular besteht aus reinem ASCII Text.
                   Wenn Sie es aus einem Textverarbeitungsprogramm heraus
                   ausdrucken moechten, achten Sie bitte darauf, dass Sie
                   einen Zeichensatz mit gleichmaessigem Zeichenabstand, und
                   keine Proportionalschrift ausgewaehlt haben.


--------!-register-G------------------------
KVEC -register:    Sobald Sie einen Registrierungsschluessel erhalten haben
                   koennen Sie mit dieser Option das Programm registrieren
                   lassen. Das Programm fragt Sie nach Ihrem Namen, der
                   Seriennummer und nach Ihrem Registrierungsschluessel. Bitte 
                   geben Sie alle Buchstaben und Ziffern genau so ein, wie Sie 
                   auf der Registrierungsbestaetigung, die Sie vom Autor 
                   erhalten haben, abgedruckt sind. Wenn Sie die Informationen 
                   richtig eingegeben haben, wird eine Meldung erscheinen, die 
                   sich fuer die Registrierung bedankt. Ihr Registrierungs-
                   schluessel ist fuer alle 'Bugfixes' und Updates von KVEC 
                   gueltig.

--------!-readpar-G-------------------------
KVEC -readpar:     KVEC liest die Dateinamen und zusaetzliche Parameter
                   aus einer Parameter-Datei ein (statt von der Kommando-
                   Zeile). Bitte beachten Sie, dass die Parameter-Datei im
                   aktuellen Verzeichnis stehen muss. Die Datei ist vom Typ
                   ASCI und kann mit jedem Texteditor bearbeitet werden.
                   Kommentare in der Parameter-Datei muessen mit einem
                   #-Zeichen beginnen und koennen ueberall nach einem
                   Parameter oder am Beginn einer Zeile erscheinen.

KVEC -readpar [Datei]:
                   KVEC liest die Dateinamen und zusaetzliche Parameter
                   aus der Parameterdatei mit dem Namen [Datei];


--------!-rename-G--------------------------
KVEC *.jpg *.jpg -rename: (Nur Windows-Version). Diese spezielle Anweisung 
                   dient zum Umbenennen von mehreren Dateien. Die 
                   umbenannten Dateien haben das Prefix: "high_". Dies ist 
                   nuetzlich in Vorbereitung zusammen mit dem Switch 
                   "-html". Im Allgemeinen wird dieses Kommando fuer JPG-
                   Dateien angewendet werden. Hier ein Beispiel:
                   'kvec bild*.jpg *.jpg -rename'

--------!-writepar-G------------------------
KVEC -writepar:    Erzeugt eine KVEC Parameter-Datei. Der Benutzer wird
                   aufgefordert, Dateinamen und zusaetzliche Parameter
                   einzugeben. Der Name der Datei lautet immer 'KVEC.PAR'
                   und die Datei wird immer ins aktuelle Verzeichnis
                   geschrieben. Sie koennen Kommentare an die
                   eingegebenen Parameter anhaengen (siehe oben). Parameter
                   muessen immer mit einem '-'Zeichen beginnen.
                   Nach dem die Parameterdatei erzeugt wurde, muss das
                   Programm erneut mit der Option '-readpar' gestartet
                   werden.

KVEC -writepar [Datei]:
                   Erzeugt eine KVEC Parameter-Datei mit dem Namen [Datei]

--------!-end of writepar-G-----------------

Die anderen Parameter muessen nach dem Dateinamen angegeben werden:

--------!-antialiasing-G--------------------
-antialiasing <N>: (Nur fuer Vektor-Raster-Konvertierung): Anti-Aliasing 
                   eingeschaltet beim Rendern.
                   <N>: 0: Kein Antialiasing, 1: gute Qualitaet, 2: beste
                   <-N>: wie <N>, erzeugt jedoch kompaktere Linien

--------!-bezier-G--------------------------
-bezier:           Erzeugt in der Output-Datei Bezierkurven statt Geraden.
                   Vektorbilder aus Bezierkurven koennen beliebig ver-
                   groessert werden, ohne dass Ecken oder Kanten auftauchen.
                   Fuer Ausgabe-Formate, die keine Bezierkurven untersttzen
                   wird der Bezier-Algorithmus simuliert und durch Polygone
                   angenaehert.
                   
--------!-bkcolor-G-------------------------
-bkcolor <r> <g> <b>: Setzt Hintergrundfarbe zum Zeichnen von benutzer-
                   definierten Funktionen (see switch '-function')

--------!-black-G---------------------------
-black:            Ausgabe-Farbe fuer Vektor-Bilder ist immer schwarz

--------!-centerline-G----------------------
-centerline mixed: Die Wirkung dieses Parameters haengt vom Wert des Para-
                   meters -lwidth ab: (in Verbindung mit -centerline hat der
                   Parameter -lwidth eine etwas andere Bedeutung)
                   Vor der Vektorisierung werden alle gefundenen Objekte
                   auf Ihre maximale Dicke hin untersucht. Alle Objekte
                   mit einer Dicke kleiner als -lwidth werden als Linien-
                   objekte behandelt; alle anderen Objekte werden normal
                   vektorisiert.
                   Die Vektorisierung von Linienobjekten ergibt keine
                   Randlinien, die das Objekt umschliessen, sondern einzelne
                   Linien, die entlang einer Mittellinie durch das Objekt
                   gehen. Die tatsaechliche Liniendicke dieser aus der
                   Vektorisierung hervorgegangenen Linie wird so gewaehlt,
                   dass die Flaeche des Linienobjekts etwa mit der Flaeche
                   des urspruenglichen Objekts uebereinstimmt.
                   (Manche Ausgabe-Formate unterstuetzen leider keine variable
                   Liniendicke). Das ist der Default-Wert.

-centerline lines: Wie bei 'centerline mixed', jedoch werden nur Linien-
                   objekte erzeugt. Alle anderen Objekte werden verworfen.
-centerline off:   Schaltet Centerline Vektorisierung aus (Default)

--------!-colspace-G------------------------
                   Waehlt den internen Farbraum aus, der von KVEC benutzt wird.
                   Die Wahl des Farbraumes macht sich bemerkbar, wenn mit Farb-
                   separierung gearbeitet wird, oder wenn zusaetzliche  
                   Bitmap-Verarbeitung durchgefuehrt wird ("process" Option).
-colspace rgb:     RGB color space (Default).
-colspace rb:      RB color space 
-colspace gb:      GB color space 
-colspace gr:      RG color space 
-colspace cmyk:    CMYK color space
-colspace cy:      CY color space
-colspace my:      MY color space
-colspace mc:      CM color space
                   Achtung: Wenn ein anderer Farbraum als RGB oder CMYK ausge-
                   waehlt wurde, so werden die Farben so optimiert, dass der
                   optische Eindruck moeglichst nahe an den Originalfarben liegt.

--------!-colseparation-G-------------------
                   Waehlt den Typ der Farbseparation. Die Ausgabedatei wird
                   nur die angegebenen Farbkomponenten enthalten.
                   Man beachte, dass fuer cmyk Separation auch der richtige
                   entsprechende Farbraum ausgewaehlt wurde.
-colsep rgb:       keine Farbseparation (Default).
-colsep cmyk:      keine Farbseparation 
-colsep rb:        R und B Komponenten 
-colsep gb:        G und B Komponenten 
-colsep gr:        R und G Komponenten 
-colsep cy:        C und Y Komponenten
-colsep my:        M und Y Komponenten
-colsep mc:        C und M Komponenten
-colsep rr:        separiert R Farbe 
-colsep gg:        separiert G Farbe 
-colsep bb:        separiert B Farbe 
-colsep cc:        separiert C Farbe 
-colsep mm:        separiert M Farbe 
-colsep yy:        separiert Y Farbe 
                   Achtung: Es ist praktisch, bei der Separierung von einzel-
                   nen Farbkomponenten eine Datei mit Graustufen zu erzeugen.
                   Das kann durch die gleichzeitige Angabe der Option "-black"
                   erreicht werden.


--------!-coord-G---------------------------
                   Waehlt den Typ der internen Skalierung von Koordinaten
-coord optimize:   Koordinaten werden evtl. neu skaliert um eine bessere     
                   Aufloesung zu erzielen (Default)
-coord pixel:      Das urspruengl. Pixel-Koordinatensystem wird benutzt.


--------!-dimension-G-----------------------
-dimension  N:     Gibt die maximale Ausdehnung (in X- oder y- Richtung)
                   des erzeugten (Raster)-Bildes an. Default: 512 Pixel.
                   WICHTIG: Dieser Parameter wird nur dann ausgewertet, falls
                   die Input-Datei vom Typ einer Vektorgrafik oder 'null' ist.

--------!-xdim-G----------------------------
-xdim  N:          Gibt die maximale Ausdehnung (in X- Richtung)
                   des erzeugten (Raster)-Bildes an. Default: Originalwert

--------!-ydim-G----------------------------
-ydim  N:          Gibt die maximale Ausdehnung (in Y- Richtung)
                   des erzeugten (Raster)-Bildes an. Default: Originalwert

--------!-drcolor-G-------------------------
-drcolor <r> <g> <b>: Setzt Linienfarbe zum Zeichnen von benutzer
                   definierten Funktionen (see switch '-function')

--------!-dither-G--------------------------
-dither off:       Schaltet 'Dithering' aus (Default-Einstellung)        
-dither linear:    Schaltet 'Dithering' ein
                   Bitte beachten Sie, dass Dithering nur stattfindet, wenn 
                   das Ausgabeformat vom Typ 'Raster' ist.

--------!-dst-G-----------------------------
-dst dist <N>:     Gibt den Abstand zwischen zwei Stichen an (in 0.1 mm)               
-dst width <N>:    Gibt die die Dicke des Fadens an (in 0.1 mm)               
-dst fill hollow:  Farbige Flchen werden nicht gefllt               
-dst fill hatch:   Erzeugt "schraffierte" Linien (simulierte Fllung,Default)               
-dst fill zickzag: Erzeugt "Zickzack"-Linien als Fllung                

--------!-dxfopt-G--------------------------
-dxfopt type 2dim: Erzeugt 2-dimensionale Koordinaten (falls als Ausgabe-  
                   format das DXF-Format gewaehlt wurde (Default).
-dxfopt type 3dim: Erzeugt 3-dimensionale Koordinaten (falls als Ausgabe-   
                   format das DXF-Format gewaehlt wurde.
-dxfopt form unix: Fuegt nur <LF> (line feed) an Zeilenenden ein (Default)
-dxfopt form dos:  Fuegt <CR> <LF> an Zeilenenden ein 

--------!-fill-G----------------------------
Die 'Fuell'-Paremeter geben an, wie die erzeugten Polylines/Polygone 
interpretiert werden sollen:

-fill solid:       Polygone sind stets geschlossen, d.h. der letzte Punkt eines
                   Polygones ist identisch mit dem ersten. Die Flaecheninhalte
                   der Polygone werden mit individuellen Farben gefuellt.
                   (Das ist die Default-Fuelleinstellung). Der 'sort'
                   Parameter sollte in diesem Fall nicht 'min' sein, da die
                   groesseren Polygone die kleineren ueberdecken und
                   verstecken wuerden.

-fill line:        Es werden Polylines mit individuellen Farben erzeugt. Die
                   Polylines sind nicht geschlossen. Dies ist die bevorzugte
                   Einstellung wenn die Output-Datei fuer einen Plotter
                   bestimmt ist. Der Plotter-Stift wird keine Farben ueber-
                   einander zeichnen. Das 'Layout' haengt vom Sortierparameter
                   'sort' ab. Mit den Parametern 'reduce' und 'smooth' koennen
                   Sie nochmals das Ergebnis der Vektorisierung verfeinern.       

-fill contour:     Wie bei '-fill solid', jedoch wird das Innere der Polygone
                   nicht gefuellt. Linien mit unterschiedlicher Farbe koennen
                   sich evtl. ueberdecken. Das 'Layout' haengt vom Sortier-
                   parameter 'sort' ab.

--------!-font-G----------------------------
-font:             Die Angabe dieses Parameters bewirkt, dass KVEC einen
                   optimierten Parametersatz erzeugt, der speziell fuer
                   die Vektorisierung von dunklem Text auf hellem Hinter-
                   grund optimiert ist. Allen Objekten wird eine einzige
                   'dunkle' Farbe zugeordnet. Die Sortierreihenfolge "local"
                   wird hierbei automatisch eingeschaltet, so da Subpolygone
                   mit Transparenzfarbe erzeugt werden knnen.

--------!-format-G--------------------------
Die Format-Parameter geben das gewuenschte Output-Format an:
(Bitte beachten Sie, dass KVEC das Output-Format auch aus der Dateiendung der
Input-Date bestimmen kann, falls keine Formatangabe verwendet wird.)

-format wmf:       Outputformat ist Windows Metafile Format, *.WMF               
-format amf:       Outputformat ist ALDUS WMF Metafile, *.WMF

-format kvc:       Outputformat ist KVEC Vektor Format 
-format xfig:      Outputformat ist XFIG Vektor Format(Linux Zeichenprogramm)
-format pcs:       Outputformat ist Pfaff PCS Format
-format dst:       Outputformat ist Tajiama DST Format
-format wav:       Outputformat ist WAV
-format svg:       Outputformat ist SVG (scalable Vector Graphics)
-format svgz:      Outputformat ist SVGZ (compressed scalable Vector Graphics)
-format swf:       Outputformat ist SWF (Macromedia Flash MX, DEFAULT)
                   Der Macromedia Flash MX Editor akzeptiert nur bestimmte
                   Anordnung von Polygonen die mit dem switch
                   '-winding' eingestellt werden koennen.
-format png:       Outputformat ist PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
-format jpeg:      Outputformat ist JPEG
-format html:      (Nur Windows-Version)
                   Hinweis: '-format html' ist ein Synonym fuer den folgenden
                   Satz von Parametern:
                   '-format jpg'  '-hmtl source default','-html screen default', 
                   '-html preview default', '-mode isotrop'
                   Dieses Format ist eigentlich kein richtiges Ausgabeformat,
                   sondern bietet die Moeglichkeit fuer eine sehr spezielle 
                   Anwendung: Nehmen wir an, Sie haben viele JPG-Dateien und
                   Sie moechten einen Satz von html-Dateien erzeugen, mit denen
 	           Sie mit einem Browser bequem alle Bilder betrachten koennen.
                   Beispiel: Sie mchten Hunderte oder Tausende von Bildern
                   auf einer Web-Seite verffentlichen und einen schnellen
                   Zugang zum Betrachten der Bilder bieten. 
                   Kvec wird fuer jede einzelne Bild-Datei eine HTML Datei 
                   erzeugen. Eine HTML Datei 'directory.htm' wird ebenfalls 
                   erzeugt. Diese enthlt Links auf die einzelnen html-Dateien
                   durch 'Preview'-Bilder. Jedes Bild wird in drei Auflsungen
                   erzeugt: 
                   niedrig (preview), mittel ('Screen-resolution') und hoch 
                   (zum Download). Nehmen wir an, eine unserer Input-Dateien 
                   heisst 'test01.bmp', dann werden folgende Dateien erzeugt: 
                   'source_test01.jpg', 'screen_test01.jpg', 'previe_test01.jpg' 
 
                   Der folgende Kommandozeilenaufruf wird dies alles bewirken: 
                   
                   kvec source_dir\test*.bmp destination_dir\*.htm 

                   Nehmen wir an wir haben 100 Input Dateien eines beliebigen
                   lesbaren Input-Formates:
                   KVEC wird dann 300 JPEG Dateien im Zielverzeichnis erzeugen.
                   KVEC wird ebenso  100 HTML Dateien mit Links zu den 
                   erzeugten Bilddateien generieren. 
                   Die 'Preview' Bilder werden in der Datei 'directory.htm',
                   die ebenfalls im Ziel-Verzeichnis erzeugt wird, angezeigt. 

                   Siehe auch: '-html ...'

--------!-function-G------------------------
-function ...:     (siehe auch: '-nstep', '-bkcolor', '-drcolor', '-xmin',
                   '-xmax', '-ymin', '-ymax', '-tmin', 'tmax', -lwidth')
                   Diese Funktion betrifft nicht die Bearbeitung von Bilddateien.
                   Der Parameter '-function' erzeugt Funktionsgraphen von math.
                   Funktionen, deren Formeln eingegeben werden knnen.       
                   Die Definition von math. Funktionen beinhaltet auch die
                   Definition von benutzerspezifischen Konstanten. Da die Defi-
                   nition von Funktionen und Variablen sehr lang sein kann, wird
                   nicht empfohlen, die Parameter als Kommandozeilenparameter
                   einzugeben. Es ist wesentlich praktischer alle Definitionen
                   und Parameter in einer KVEC Parameterdatei anzugeben.	
                   Alle Zeichenketten, die dem '-function' Schluesselwort folgen,
                   werden als 'C-style' Kommandos interpretiert, mit denen bis
                   zu 8 Funktionen und 100 Variablen definiert werden knnen.
                   Das Schluesselwort 'endfunc' (ohne ";") beendet diesen Defini-
                   tionsteil. Die zuweisungen von Variablen u. Konstanten muessen
                   der Definition der Funktionen vorausgehen! Folglich knnen
                   Variablen auch nicht mit Funktionsergebnissen oder Ausdruecken
                   initialisiert werden.
                   Es gelten folgende Einschraenkungen:
                   Alle Funktionen muessen den folgenden Namenskonventionen ent-
                   sprechen:                   
                   
                   f?(argument)   ('?' ein beliebiges alphanumerisches Zeichen)
                                  ('argument' kann eines von (x,y,z,t,i) sein)
                   x?(argument) y?(argument)  ('?' belieb. alphanumerisches Zch.)
                            (Parameterdarstellung einer Funktion)
                   r?(phi-argument) ('?' ein beliebiges alphanumerisches Zeichen)
                            ('argument' muss 'p' lauten)
                            (Darstellung in Ploarkoordinaten)
                   Erlaubt ist ebenfalls: x?(), y?() or f?() 
                        (ohne Funk.-Argument, Anwendung: Iterative Funktionen)
                   Wichtig: Funktionsnamen (zwei Zeichen lang) koennen auch als
                   Variablen benutzt werden. Das ist sinnvoll fuer Initialisierungen
                   in iterativen Funktionen oder Schleifen.

                   Da Initialisierungen von Konstanten und Variablen den Funktions-
                   definitionen vorausgehen, sind Variablen immer 'global' und
                   gelten fuer jede der (max. 8 moeglichen) Funktionen.
                   
                   Ein paar Beispiele:  f1(x)=sin(x); fa(t)=cos(t); (gueltig)
                                        fabc(x)=x; (ungueltig)
                                        f1(x) = cos(x); (ungueltig)
                                        f2(x)=SUM(n=1,100,x^n/n!);  (gueltig)                   
                                        x3(t)=cos(t); y3(t)=sin(t); (gueltig)
                                        y(x)=exp(x);  (ungueltig)
                                        x1(i)=KV_PRIMES[i]; y1(i)=i; (gueltig)
                                        r1(p)=0.5*p; (gueltig)
                   
                   Jede Anweisung endet mit ";". Innerhalb einer Anweisung sollten
                   nach Moeglichkeit keine Leerzeichen oder andere "white-space"
                   Zeichen stehen. Anweisungen werden jedoch durch Leerzeichen oder
                   'white-spaces' voneinander getrennt.                   
                   Insgesamt sind bis zu 8 verschiedene Funktionen erlaubt.
                   Die Funktionsnamen bestehen aus 2 Zeichen und muessen mit einem
                   der folgenden Zeichen beginnen: 'f', 'x', 'y' oder 'r'. Das
                   zweite Zeichen ist ein beliebiges alphanumerisches Zeichen.
                   Wenn eine Parameterdarstellung vorliegt z.Bsb. x1(t)=..,y1(t)=..)
                   muss die Definition der x1() Funktion der Definition der y1()-Funkt.
                   vorausgehen. Eine Parameterdarstellung zhlt als eine Funktion.                   

                   Wenn die Definitionsreihenfolge in Parameterdarstellungen ver-
                   tauscht wird, ist das Ergebnis unvorhersagbar.
                   Das Funktionsargument muss eines der folgenden Zeichen sein: 
                   'x', 'y', 'z', 't' or 'p' (im Falle von Polarkoordinaten). 
                   Ausdruecke koennen ineinander mit Klammern '(', ')' verschachtelt
                   werden. Konstanten koennen am Anfang wiefolgt definiert werden
                   (Beispiele):
                   ABC=1.234;  SQ2=1.414; ...
                   Achtung: Konstanten koennen nicht durch Ausdruecke definiert werden
                   (nur durch Zahlenwerte).
                   
                   Folgende mathematische Operatoren sind erlaubt:
                   '+' Addition oder unitaeres (vorangestelltes) '+'
                   '-' Subtraktion or unitary (vorangestelltes) '-'
                   '*' Multiplikation
                   '/' Division
                   '%' Modulus

                   '!' Fakultaet (kann auch auf Ausdruecke angewendet werden)
                   'SUM' Summation. Syntax: SUM(n=<start>,<end>,<func>);
                        z. Bsp.: SUM(n=1,100,x^n/n!);
                   'PROD' Produkte. Syntax: PROD(n=<start>,<end>,<func>);
                   'ITER' Iterations-Schleifen. Syntax: 
                          ITER(n=<start>,<end>,<epsilon>,<f?=init-value>,<func>);
                   'iterate' (erweiterte Iterationsschleifen) Syntax: 
                      iterate(n=<start>,<end>,<epsilon>,<(list of var-initializations>);

                   In den SUM, PROD or ITER- Anweisungen kann jeweils nur eine Schleifen-
                   variable definiert werden; Schleifen-Variablen muessen durch (konstante)
                   Zahlenwerte initialisiert werden.                   
                   Die 'ITER'-Anweisung ist fuer einfache Funktionen einer Variablen
                   (z. Bsp. f1(x)=<Ausdruck, der x enthaelt>) geeignet. Der Funktionsterm
                   muss innerhalb der Anweisung als der letzte Ausdruck definiert werden.                   
                   Der Funktionsterm kann den Funktionsnamen selbst als Variable enthalten
                   (Iteration). Die Iteration startet mit einem Wert <start> der Schleifen-
                   variablen und endet mit einem Wer groesser oder gleich <end> dieser
                   Variablen. Die Iteration endet ebenfalls, wenn die Differenz des 
                   Ergebnisses zwischen zwei aufeinander folgenden Iterationen kleiner
                   als <epsilon> ist. Iterationsschleifen fuer Funktionen in Parameter-
                   Darstellung (x(t), y(t) ist mit der 'ITER' Anweisung nicht moeglich.
                   Fuer diesen Zweck ist die erweiterte Anweisung 'iterate(...)' gedacht.
                   
                   Syntax: 
                   iterate(n=<start>,<end>,<epsilon>,<(Liste v. Variablen-Initialisierungen>);
                   
                   Die 'iterate'-Anweisung beinhaltet selbst nicht die Funktionsdefinition.                   
                   Die Funktionsdefinition(en) muessen unmittelbar auf die 'iterate'-
                   Anweisung folgen. Mit dieser Anweisung koennen auch Funktionen in Parameter
                   darstellung oder iterative Funktionen von zwei Variablen behandelt werden.                 
                   Die Variablen-Definitionen und -Initialisierungen innerhalb der 'iterate'-
                   Anweisung sind nur fuer die der 'iterate'-Anweisung folgende Funktionen 
                   gueltig (nicht global).

                   Wichtig: Functionen koennen auch ohne Funktionsargumente definiert
                   werden (z. Bsp.  'x1() = ....'). Der Funktionsterm kann auch den Funktions-
                   namen als Parameter enthalten (Iteration). Die Anzahl der Iterationen
                   wird dann durch den Parameter '-nstep' gesteuert. (nstep ist global und
                   wird ausserhalb des durch die Schluesselwoerter '-function' und 'endfunc'
                   definierten Bereiches definiert. 'nstep'  kann jedoch auch 'lokal'
                   definiert werden (ist dann nur fuer die folgende Funktion gueltig)
                   z. Bsp 'nstep <N>' (ohne fuehrendes '-' Zeichen).
                   Der aktuelle Wert der Iterations Schleifenvariablen kann innerhalb der
                   Funktion benutzt werden durch den Namen 'II' (interne Schleifenvariable).
                   Da II von KVEC verwaltet wird, sollten der Variablen 'II' keine Werte
                   zugewiesen werden.                   

                   Alle mathematischen Funktion, die im 'ANSI' Standard definiert sind,
                   koennen verwendet werden. Damit sind die meisten elementaren mathematischen
                   Funktionen erfasst. Die folgenden hoeheren math. Funktionen koennen
                   ebenfalls verwendet werden (im Moment, diese Menge wird noch erweitert
                   werden)

                          Die Modi 'xt/yt/abs' sind nuetzlich zum Zeichnen der Real-
                          bzw. Imaginaerteile von komplexen Funktionen in Abhaengigkeit
                          eines Parameters 't'.

                   Wichtig: Grafische Einstellungen gelten nur fuer die aktuell
                   ausgewertete benutzerdefinierte (= aktive) Funktion (Ausnahme:
                   Farbeinstellung fuer den Hintergrund). Diese Einstellungen gelten
                   individuell fuer die jeweilige folgende Funktion. Falls keine
                   graphischen Einstellungen agegeben werden, gelten Deafaultwerte.
                   Die graphischen Anweisungen muessen der jeweiligen Funktion
                   vorausgehen. Die Einstellung 'polyline' oder 'polygon' erzeugt
                   kontinuierlich gezeichnete Linien zwischen Interpolationspunkten
                   mit dem eingestellten Abstand (der sich aus 'nstep' und den Werten
                   fuer 'xmin' und 'ymin' ergibt). Die Auswahl von 'Markern' erzeugt
                   'Marker'Symbole (Kreise, Rechtecke, Linien segmente) an den jeweiligen
                   Plot-Positionen ohne dass Linien zwischen den Punkten gezeichnet
                   werden.
                   WICHTIG: Die absolute Groesse der Marker-Symbole haengt von der
                   'Plot-Vorgeschichte' aller gezeichneten Objekte ab. Deshalb sollten
                   Marker als letzte Aktion gezeichnet werden (nach dem alle anderen 
                   Funktionen gezeichnet wurden).

                   Falls als Ausgabeformat 'SVG' oder 'SWF' gewhlt wurde, sollte
                   die Groesse und Dimension des Ausgabebildes mit folgenden Parametern
                   eingestellt werden:                   
                   
                   -paper user <xdim in mm> <ydim in mm>       und/oder

                   Die geplotteten Koordinatenwerte koennen ebenfalls ausgegeben
                   werden (auf das angegebene Ausgabegert) durch die Angabe von:
                   
                   '-debug plot'


--------!-gapfill-G-------------------------
-gapfill N:        Diese Parameter steuert, ob der Vektorisierer waehrend
                   der Vektorisierung eines Objekts ueber Luecken
                   'hinwegspringen' kann. Der Wert N muss in Zehntel eines
                   Pixels angegeben werden. Erlaubte Werte: 0 bis 30.

--------!-grit-G----------------------------
-grit N:           Mit diesem Parameter kann man angeben, ob kleine Details
                   bei der Vektorisierung erfasst werden sollen, oder nicht.
                   Polygone oder Polylines die eine Flaeche mit weniger als
                   N Pixels umfassen, werden 'weggefiltert'. Der Defaultwert
                   fuer 'grit' haengt von den Dimensionen und der Farbtiefe
                   des Bildes ab. Bei -grit 0 findet keine Filterung statt.
                   Die Benutzung eines Wertes N > 0 vergroessert die Rechen-
                   zeit und vergroessert auch erheblich den RAM Speicherbedarf.
                   Wenn Sie sparsam mit Speicher umgehen muessen sollten Sie
                   fuer -grit den Wert 0 und fuer -quantize einen kleineren
                   Wert waehlen.

--------!-hatch-G---------------------------
Die Schraffierungs-Parameter werden nur ausgewertet falls das Ausgabe-Format
DXF, PCS, DST oder HPGL ist.

-hatch1 density N: Die max. Anzahl von horizontalen Schraffierungslinien wird
                   auf N begrenzt (der Wert 0 schaltet Schraffierung aus)
-hatch2 density N: Die max. Anzahl von vertikalen Schraffierungslinien wird
                   auf N begrenzt (der Wert 0 schaltet Schraffierung aus)
-hatch1 angle N:   Winkel fuer horizontale Schraffierungs-Linien
                   (Default: 40 Grad)
-hatch2 angle N:   Winkel fuer vertikale Schraffierungs-Linien
                   (Default: 40 Grad)

--------!-html-G----------------------------
Die html Parameter kontrollieren den Aufbau zustzliche erzeugter html Dateien,
die Links auf die erzeugten output-Dateien enthalten. (Siehe auch: '-format html')

-html source none: Keine Generierung von hochauflsenden Bildern (Auflsung der
                   Quell-Dateien) findet statt. Individuelle Html Dateien erhalten
                   keine Links zu hoch-auflsenden (Original-Bildern).
-html source original: Kopien der Original Bild-Dateien (Umbenennung nach source_xxx..)
                   werden im Ziel-Verzeichnis erzeugt. Individuelle HTML-Dateien 
                   erhalten Download-Links auf diese Dateien.
-html source format: Konvertierung und Erzeugung von hoch-auflsenden Dateien
                   bei Anwendung aller Parameter und des Ausgabe-Formates. Die
                   Dateien werden im Ziel-Verzeichnis erzeugt. Die Html Dateien
                   erhalten Download-Links auf diese Dateien.
-html source default: (Wie 'format'). Jedoch: Kopien (an Stelle von Konversionen)
                   werden erzeugt, falls die Quell- und Ziel-Formate identisch sind.
                   Falls die Bilddimensionen der Quell-Dateien kleiner als 
                   dimx <=800 und dimy <= 600 sind  werden keine hochauflsenden
                   Bilddateien erzeugt und auch keine entsprechenden Download Links.
                   (jedoch Einbettung der 'Screen-resolution" Dateien).

-html screen none: keine Generierung von Bildern mit 'Bildschirm-Auflsung' 
                   findet statt. Individuelle Html Dateien erhalten auch
                   keine Einbettungen der Bilder mit Bildschrim-Auflsung.
-html screen original: Kopien der Original Bild-Dateien (Umbenannt nach 'screen_xxx..")
                   werden im Ziel-Verzeichnis erzeugt. Individuelle HTML-Dateien 
                   erhalten Einbettungen dieser Dateien.
-html screen format: Konvertierung und Erzeugung von 'Bildschirm-auflsenden' Dateien
                   bei Anwendung aller Parameter und des Ausgabe-Formates. Die
                   Dateien werden im Ziel-Verzeichnis erzeugt. Die Html Dateien
                   erhalten Einbettungen dieser Dateien.
-html screen default: (wie 'format'). Jedoch: Nur der Format-parameter
                   wird beruecksichtigt und 'Resampling' auf 800*600 pixel (isotrop).


-html preview none: Keine Konvertierung zu 'preview-resolution' Bildern. 
                   'directory.htm' wird nicht erzeugt. 
-html preview original: Kopien der Original Bild-Dateien (umbenannt auf 'previe_xxx..")
                   werden im Ziel-Verzeichnis erzeugt. Die Bilder werden in die 
                   Datei 'directory.htm' eingebettet.
-html preview format: Konvertierung und Erzeugung von 'preview resolution' Dateien
                   bei Anwendung aller Parameter und des Ausgabe-Formates. Die
                   Dateien werden im Ziel-Verzeichnis erzeugt. Die Datei 'diectory.htm'
                   erhaelt eine Einbettung dieser Dateien. 
-html preview default: (wie 'format'). Jedoch: Das Ausgabe-Format ist 'JPEG'
                   und 'Resampling' auf 60*60 pixel (isotrop).

--------!-jpg-G-----------------------------
-jpg quality <N>:  Gibt die Qualitt des JPEG Bildes an (output)
                   Erlaubte Werte: 1-100 (Default: 75)
-jpg grayscale on: Generiert  JPEG Bilder mit Grauskala 
-jpg grayscale off: Farbige JPEG Bilder (Default)
    

--------!-justify-G-------------------------
Die 'justify'-Parameter werden nur ausgewertet, falls das Input- und das
Output-Format beide vom Typ 'Raster' sind (keine Vektor-Formate). Die Farb-
tiefe der Input Datei muss 1 Bit betragen (S/W Bild). Die Hauptanwendung
fuer diese Option wird das Justieren (Zurechtruecken) und Saeubern von
'gescannten' S/W Bildern sein, um sie fuer die Einbettung in Dokumente
vorzubereiten. Die Defaultwerte fuer die 'justify' Parameter sind optimiert
fuer 300 dpi DIN A4 Bilder, die Text enthalten.
Kopien haben oft schmutzige schwarze Raender oder sind leicht verdreht, da
die Vorlage beim Kopieren etwas verrutscht wurde. KVEC kann diese Effekte
automatisch wieder korrigieren, wenn ein geeigneter Satz von Justierungs-
Parametern verwendet wird.

-justify type off:   Keine Bereinigung oder Justierung (Default).
-justify type rotate: Justierung wird durchgefuehrt (Nur Drehung)     
-justify type all:   Justierung wird durchgefuehrt (Drehung und Saeuberung
                     der 'schmutzigen' Raender durch Abschneiden).
-justify type angle: Keine Justierung wird durchgefuehrt (nur Bestimmung
                     des Drehwinkels)
-justify phimax N:   Maximal erlaubter Drehwinkel. Dies ist der max. Ver-
                     drehungswinkel, der korrigiert werden kann. Achtung:
                     Die Rechenzeit waechst linear mit der Groesse dieses
                     Winkels. Default: 5.0 Grad.
-justify parameter N1 N2 N3:
                     Diese Werte steuern die Wirkung der internen Algorithmen.
                     (Detektierung von grossen rechteckigen Bloecken, von denen
                     widerum der Rotationswinkel abgeleitet wird).
                     N1: 'Verdickungs'-Faktor. Jedes Pixel wird um diesen Faktor
                         vergroessert, um enthaltene Block-Strukturen leichter
                         detektierbar zu machen. Default: 16
                     N2: min. Filterwert. Zusammenhaengende Gebiete mit einer
                         Anzahl von Pixeln kleiner als N2 werden entfernt bevor
                         der interne 'Block-Detektierungsalgorithmus' startet.
                         Default: 50
                     N3  max. Filterwert. Zusammenhaengende Gebiete mit einer
                         Anzahl von Pixeln groesser als N3 werden entfernt bevor
                         der interne 'Block-Detektierungsalgorithmus' startet.
                         Default: 400
                     Bemerkung: Die Defaultwerte wurden fuer DIN A4 Bilder 
                     (300 dpi), die einen Durchschnittstext enthalten, opti-
                     miert. Die durchschn. Anzahl von Pixeln liegt im Bereich
                     von 50 bis zu 400 Pixel pro Buchstaben).
                     Dies stellt sicher, dass nur die Teile des Bildes, die
                     Text-Information enthalten, fuer die Bestimmung des
                     Drehwinkels relevant sind.         

                     Fuer andere Arten von S/W Bildern (z.B. elektronische
                     Schaltplaene) koennen andere Parameterwerte evtl. zu
                     besseren Ergebnissen fuehren.
-justify fill ...:   Durch Rotation erzeugte Raender u. Ecken werden gefuellt:
-justify fill black: schwarzer Farbe (bzw. der aehnlichsten schw. Farbe)
-justify fill white: weisser Farbe (bzw. der aehnlichsten weiss. Farbe), DEFAULT
-justify fill user <R> <G> <B>: benutzer-spezifischen Farbe
-justify preserve off: Ausgabebild kann andere Dimensionen haben als Inputbild
-justify preserve on:  Ausgabebild hat die gleichen Dimensionen wie Inputbild

--------!-kvc-G-----------------------------
-kvc compress none: Schaltet jegliche Kompression fuer das KVC Format aus  
-kvc compress lzw: Waehlt die LZW Kompressionstechnik fuer das KVC Format

--------!-lwidth-G--------------------------
-lwidth:           Gibt die Dicke der Linien der erzeugten Ausgabevektoren an
                   (in Zehntel eines Pixels).
                   Erlaubte Werte: 0-1000. Defaultwert: 0.
                   Bitte beachten Sie die veraenderte Bedeutung dieses
                   Parameters, falls er zusammen mit der Option
                   -centerline gebraucht wird. In diesem Fall ist der
                   Defaultwert 100.

--------!-maxpoints-G-----------------------
-maxpoints:        Gibt die max. erlaubte Anzahl von Punkten fuer die   
                   erzeugten Polylines und Polygone an. Das ist nuetzlich
                   wenn KVEC Vektoren mit einer Laenge von mehr als 32767
                   Punkten erzeugt und als Ausgabe-Format WMF gewaehlt wurde.

--------!-mode-G----------------------------
-mode iso:         Isotroper Modus. Dieser Modus bewahrt das Y/X-Verhaeltnis
                   des Bildes. (Ein Kreis wird auch im Ausgabebild ein Kreis 
                   bleiben). Das ist die Default-Einstellung.
                   (Nur fuer Postscript-, AI-, SWF- und SVG-Format, sowie
                   bei Vektor-Raster Konvertierung).

-mode aniso:       Anisotroper Modus. Das Bild wird so skaliert, dass es die
                   Papierflaeche (bzw. den "Viewport") vollstaendig ausfuellt.
                   (Nur fuer Postscript- AI-, SWF- und SVG-Format, sowie 
                   bei Vektor-Raster Konvertierung).

--------!-monitor-G-------------------------
-monitor:          Schaltet Fortschritts-Anzeige ein. Informationen ueber den
                   aktuellen Programm-Status und ueber den Programm-
                   Fortschritt (in %) werden angezeigt.

--------!-nstep-G---------------------------
-nstep <N>:        Setzt Anzahl der Schritte (Interpolationspunkte) zum
                   Zeichnen von benutzer-definierten Funktionen
                   (siehe switch '-function')

--------!-overlapp-G------------------------
-overlapp:         Bei der Angabe dieses Parameters ueberlappen sich die
                   erzeugten Vektoren geringfuegig (um genau ein Pixel).
                   Der Defaultwert ist 'keine Ueberlappung'.
                   Falls Vektorgraphiken, nachdem sie gedreht worden sind,
                   schwarze oder andersfarbige Luecken aufweisen sollten,
                   (besonders entlang den Grenzlinien benachbarter Polygone)
                   dann sollten Sie diesen Parameter angeben.

--------!-palette-G------------------------
-palette optimize: KVEC benutzt intern eine optimierte Palette wenn eine
                   Farbreduzierung vorgenommen werden muss (Default)
-palette fixed:    KVEC benutzt intern eine Standard Palette wenn eine
                   Farbreduzierung vorgenommen werden muss/soll. Diese
                   Einstellung liefert oftmals bessere Vektorisierungs-
                   Ergebnisse, besonders wenn die Farbanzahl kleiner als
                   16 Farben ist.
-palette user <n>  R1,G1,B1, .... Rn,Gn,Bn:
                   Hier kann man eine benutzer-definierte Farb Palette an- 
                   geben, die <n> Farben enthaelt. Nach dem Wert <n> folgen
                   die <n> RGB Farbeintraege. Es ist einfacher, in diesem   
                   Fall mit einer Parameter-Datei zu arbeiten, als alle RGB-
                   Werte in der Kommandozeile anzugeben.
                   Der Wert fuer n darf nicht groesser al 256 sein.
--------!-paper-G---------------------------
-paper (format):   Auswahl einer Papier-Groesse. Z. Zt. ist diese Option nur
                   fuer folgende Formate gltig:
                   Postscript, Adobe Illustrator, SWF und SVG-Format.

--------!-pattern-G-------------------------
Dieser Parameter wirkt nur auf Vektor-Objekte und ist daher fuer eine reine
Raster-Raster Formatumwandlung wirkungslos.
Die letzten drei Parameter DR, DG und DB geben jeweils die max. Farbdifferenz
fuer Farbverlaeufe bzw. Zufalls-Farbmuster an. Erlaubte Werte: 0 bis 255.
-pattern nodither   D1 D2 D3: Kein Farbverlauf (Default)       
-pattern left2right D1 D2 D3: Farbverlauf von links nach rechts
-pattern right2left D1 D2 D3: Farbverlauf von rechts nach links
-pattern top2bottom D1 D2 D3: Farbverlauf von oben nach unten   
-pattern bottom2top D1 D2 D3: Farbverlauf von unten nach oben  
-pattern inout      D1 D2 D3: Farbverlauf von innen nach aussen
-pattern outin      D1 D2 D3: Farbverlauf von aussen nach innen
-pattern randrgb    D1 D2 D3: Zufallsfarbmuster (Dithering)     

Wichtig: Bitte beachten Sie, dass das angegebene Vektor Ausgabeformat Farb- 
verlaeufe unterstuetzt. Z. Zt. gilt dies nur fuer das ART und KVC Format.
Farbverlaeufe werden jedoch immer durchgefuehrt falls das Ausgabeformat ein
Raster-Format ist (und das Eingabeformat vom Typ Vektor).

--------!-png-G-----------------------------

Die PNG-Parameter werden nur ausgewertet falls das Output-Format PNG ist:

-png bitdepth <N>: Bittiefe des PNG-Bildes. Erlaubt sind: 1,4,8,24 Bit.
                   Paletten-Bilder koennen bis 8 Bits, RGB nur 24 bit.
                   Default: 24 Bit
-png coltype gray: Erzeugt ein Graustufen-Bild
-png coltype pal:  Erzeugt ein Paletten-Bild
-png coltype rgb:  Erzeugt RGB Bild mit 24 Bit Aufloesung
-png coltype alpha2: Erzeugt Graustufen-Bild mit Alpha-Kanal 
-png coltype alpha4: Erzeugt RGB-Bild mit Alpha-Kanal
                   Default: RGB (True Color)
-png tcolor <R> <G> <B>: Waehlt eine Transparenzfarbe 
                   Default: Keine Transparenzfarbe
-png interlace:    Schltet Interlacing ein (noch nicht verfuegbar)
                   Default: Kein Interlacing
-png gamma <x>:    Waehlt einen Gamma-Wert  Default: 0.45
                   Bitte Ganzzahl eingeben. 100000 entspricht einem Wert von 1.0
-png addpalette:   Fuegt einem RGB-Bild eine Farbpalette hinzu (noch nicht verfuegbar)
                   Default: PNG RGB Dateien enthalten keine Farbpaletten
-png bkcolor <R> <G> <B>: Waehlt eine Hintergrungfarbe fuer das PNG Bild
                   Default: Keine Hintergrundfarbe
-png ppx <N>:      Setzt den "pixels per unit"-Wert fuer X-Richtung
-png ppy <N>:      Setzt den "pixels per unit"-Wert fuer Y-Richtung
-png pixunit meter: Waehlt die Unit fuer die ppx und ppy Werte: 1 meter.
-png pixunit none:  Waehlt fuer die Unit den Wert "unbekannt" (Default)

KVEC bestimmt die Werte fuer 'bitdepth' und 'coltype' aus der Input-Datei und
benutzt Default-Werte fuer die PNG-Parameter, falls keine angegeben werden.
Im Fall einer Vektor-Raster Konvertierung mit PNG als Ausgabe-Format versucht
KVEC den groesst-moeglichen Wert fuer 'bitdepth' zu verwenden. Das ist normalerweise
24 Bit, es sei denn ein anderer Wert wurde angegeben.


--------!-primes-G--------------------------
-primes <N>:       Initialisiert interne Primzahlen bis zum Wert N.
                   (Default, falls nicht angegeben : 1000000)


--------!-quantize-G------------------------
-quantize N:       Die Inputdatei wird vor Beginn der Vektorisierung auf 
                   N Farben quantisiert (falls diese mehr als N Farben
                   enthalten sollte). Der Defaultwert ist 32 Farben.
                   Fuer DXF und HPGL Format gilt der Defaultwert 8 Farben.

--------!-reduce-G--------------------------
Die 'reduce'-Parameter geben an, ob alle die Punkte eines Vektors, die auf
einer Geraden liegen, durch zwei Punkte (den Start- und den Endpunkt des
Geradenabschnittes) ersetzt (= reduziert) werden. Das verringert die Groesse
der Ausgabedatei. Da Geraden horizontal, vertikal oder schraeg liegen koennen, 
haben wir folgende Moeglichkeiten:

-reduce orthogonal:gerade horizontale und vertikale Vektorabschnitte werden
                   reduziert. Das ist der Default-Wert.
-reduce all:       Alle geraden Abschnitte (auch die schraeg liegenden)
                   werden reduziert. Bei dieser Parameterwahl koennen
                   gelegentlich kleine Luecken im Layout erscheinen.
-reduce off:       Vektoren werden, auch wenn sie Geradenabschnitte enthalten,
                   nicht reduziert. Der einzige Fall, in dem man evtl. diese
                   Einstellung waehlen wird, ist, wenn man die Geschwindigkeit
                   eines Plotterstiftes entlang langer Geradenabschnitte herab-
                   setzen moechte.

--------!-resolution-G----------------------
Die 'resolution'-Parameter haben Einfluss auf die interne Auswertung:

-resolution low:   Sehr kleine Details koennen verloren gehen (Default)
-resolution high:  Alle Details koennen erfasst werden (braucht mehr Speicher)

--------!-rotate-G--------------------------
-rotate N:         Setzt den Rotationswinkel (Wert N in Grad)
                   Die Rotation findet nur statt, wenn sich in der Befehlsliste
                   (definiert duch '-process...') ein 'rotate' Befehl befindet.
                   Der Default Rotationswinkel betraegt 40 Grad.
                   Hinweis: Die Rotation betrifft nur ein Input Rasterbild und
                   findet vor einer eventuellen Vektorisierung statt.

--------!-scale-G---------------------------
Die Skalierungs-Parameter werden nur ausgewertet falls das Ausgabe-Format
DXF oder HPGL ist.

-scale hpgl N:     Das ausgegebene HPGL-Bild wird um einen Faktor N skaliert.
-scale dxf N:      Das ausgegebene DXF-Bild wird um einen Faktor N skaliert.
                   Siehe auch -xyscale hpgl / -xyscale dxf
                   WICHTIG: scale dxf skaliert ebenfalls SWF Output!
--------!-sort-G----------------------------
Die Sortier-Parameter geben an, in welcher Reihenfolge die Vektoren in der
Output-Datei erscheinen:

-sort nosort:      Vektoren werden nicht sortiert. Konturen oder Linien
                   mit unterschiedlichen Farben koennen sich ueberdecken,
                   die inneren Gebiete der Vektoren jedoch nicht. 

-sort max:         Dieser Parameter haengt von der Einstellung des Parameters
                   'fill' ab: Beim Fuelltyp 'solid' werden die Polygone
                   nach der Groesse der umschlossenen Flaeche sortiert. Beim
                   Typ 'line' oder 'contour' wird nach der Laenge der Vektoren
                   sortiert. Die Sortierreihenfolge ist vom Maximum zum 
                   Minimum. Das ist die Default-Einstellung.

-sort min:         Wie bei '-sort min', jedoch ist die Sortierreihenfolge
                   vom Minimum zum Maximum. Diese Einstellung ergibt nur einen
                   Sinn, wenn der Fuelltyp nicht auf 'solid' eingestellt ist.

-sort local:       Die erzeugte Sortierreihenfolge erhaelt nimmt Ruecksicht
                   auf die lokalen topologischen Gegebenheiten.
                   D.h. Objekte werden in der Reihenfolge gezeichnet, wie sie
                   in einander verschachtelt sind. Die Sortierreihenfolge
                   innerhalb einer Gruppe von in sich verschachtelten Objekten
                   ist vom Maximum zum Minimum.
                   Benoetigt mehr Rechenzeit.
                   Wenn die Sortierreihenfolge auf "local" steht, versucht
                   KVEC Subpolygone mit Transparenzfarbe zu erzeugen. Das
                   ist ntzlich beim Vektorisieren von Text. Die "-font"
                   Option schaltet automatisch diese Sortierreihenfolge ein.

-sort color:       Polygone/Polylines werden nach ihrer Farbe sortiert.
                   Diese Einstellung ist nuetzlich fuer das HPGL-Format.

--------!-subsampling-G---------------------
-subsampling:      Die erzeugten Ouput-Vektoren werden mit einem Faktor 2
                   'unter-abgetastet'. Dadurch wird die Groesse der Output-
                   Datei reduziert. Dies fuehrt ausserdem zu einer Glaettung
                   der Vektoren. 

--------!-swf-G-----------------------------
-swf format mx:    Erzeugt Flash format MX (Default, komprimierte Ausgabe)
-swf format 6:     Flash format MX (komprimierte Ausgabe)
-swf format 5:     Flash format 5.x (unkomprimiert, kompatibel zu 5.0)
-swf compression zlib: Benutzt zlib Kompression (Default, fuer Format MX)
-swf compression none: Keine Kompression

--------!-sysmalloc-G-----------------------
-sysmalloc on:     (Default) KVEC benutzt die Speicher-Allokierungsroutinen
                   des Betriebssystems.

-sysmalloc off:    KVEC verwendet eigene Routinen zur Verwaltung des
                   Speichers. Falls die Performance von KVEC bei bestimmten
                   Bilderen abnimmt, sollte dieser Switch ausprobiert werden.

--------!-tcolor-G--------------------------
Die Transparenz Parameter werden nur ausgewertet, falls das Ausgabe-Format
gefuellte Flaechen behandeln kann.
Die Transparenz-Farbe wird im ausgegebenen Vektor-Bild unterdrueckt.
Einige Formate unterstuetzen keine Sub-Polygone. Fuer diese Formate kann
die Transparenz Option in einigen Faellen nicht richtig arbeiten.
Default: Transparenz-Option ist ausgeschaltet.

-tcolor auto:      Automatische Bestimmung der Transparenz Farbe
-tcolor color R G B: Benutzer-definierte Transparenz-Farbe (RGB Werte)

                                                                     
--------!-text-G----------------------------
-text on/off:      Erzeugung / Unterdrueckung von Text-Objekten in der Ausgabe-
                   Datei. Das betrifft nur die Formate, die Textobjekte
                   unterstuetzen: Default: -text on


--------!-tiff-G----------------------------
Die Tiff-Parameter werden nur ausgewertet falls als Ausgabe-Format das
Tiff Format gewaehlt wurde. Sie steuern die Erzeugung des Tiff-Files.

-tiff append:   Bild wird als subimage angehngt (Default: ueberschreiben)

                     Das Tiff-File wird vom Typ 'S/W' oder 'Grauskala'
                     (Tiff Klasse 'B' oder 'G')
-tiff photo black:   Photometrische Interpretation: 'MINISBLACK'
                     Das Tiff-File wird vom Typ 'S/W' oder 'Grauskala'
                     (Tiff Klasse 'B' oder 'G')
-tiff photo rgb:     Das Tiff-File bekommt 3 Farb-Komponenten (RGB)
                     (Tiff Klasse 'R') (DEFAULT)

                     (Tiff Klasse 'Y')
-tiff stripsize N:   Der 'Stripsize-Wert' des Tiff-Files hat eine Groesse von
                     N Bytes (DEFAULT: 32000).

--------!-trim-G----------------------------
-trim:             Bild optimieren. (Nur WMF Ausgabe Format)

--------!-vblack-G--------------------------
-vblack:           Es wird nur die Farbe mit den 'schwaerzesten' RGB-Werten
                   vektorisiert (holt die 'schwarzen Linien' aus dem Bild).
                   Alle Objekte mit einer anderen Farbe werden als 'helle'
                   Objekte behandelt. Alle Regionen die aus dieser 'hellen'
                   Farbe bestehen, werden ebenfalls vektorisiert.
                   Helle Gebiete, die innerhalb von schwarzen Gebieten
                   liegen werden richtig dargestellt. Man beachte, dass ein
                   kleinerer 'quantize' Wert mehr dunkle Linien erfasst.
                   Wenn der 'quantize' Wert zu groos ist, werden evtl.
                   nicht alle dunklen Linien erfasst.

--------!-voblack-G------------------------
-voblack dark:     Wie bei vblack, jedoch werden nur 'dunkle' Objekte vek-
                   torisiert. Helle Gebiete, die innerhalb von 'schwarzen'
                   Gebieten liegen werden evtl. nicht dargestellt, falls das
                   'schwarze' Gebiet vom Typ eines gefuellten Polygons ist.
-voblack nwhite:   Wie bei vblack, jedoch werden keine 'hellen' Objekte vek-
                   torisiert. Helle Gebiete, die innerhalb von anderen
                   Gebieten liegen werden evtl. nicht dargestellt, falls das
                   Gebiet vom Typ eines gefuellten Polygons ist.

--------!-viewtype-G------------------------
                   (GUI-Parameter) Waehlt den 'Viewer' fuer die KVEC-GUI.

-viewtype SWF:     (default) Macromedia Shockwave (Flash) 
-viewtype SVG:     Adobe SVG Format (Scalable vector graphics) 

--------!-winding-G-------------------------
-winding original: (Default) Der Umlaufsinn von Polygonen bleibt unver-
                   aendert (wie von der Quelle oder dem Vektorisierer)
                   uebernommen wurde.
-winding reversed: Umgekehrter Umlaufsinn. Diese Einstellung ist fuer
                   einige Typen von Input Dateien ntig. 
-winding optimized: KVEC setzt einen alternierendenden Umlaufsinn fuer
                   fuer Haupt- und Subpolygone, in Abhaengigkeit von der
                   Verschachtelungstiefe.
                   Diese Einstellungen sind nur fuer das SWF Output-
                   Format relevant (und speziell nur dann, wenn die SWF-
                   Daten im Macromedia Flash Editor weiter bearbeitet
                   werden sollen). Die gngigen Flash Player kommen mit
                   allen Kombinationen von Umlaufsinn in Polygonen
                   zurecht.
--------!-xmin-G---------------------------

Auf die folgenden Parameter haben nur registrierte Benutzer Zugriff:

Die Debug-Parameter geben den Grad (d.h. die Ausfuehrlichkeit) des 
Debug-Outputs an. Debug-Output bedeutet, dass ein Protokoll ueber den Fort-
schritt der Vektorisierung auf dem Bildschirm ausgegeben wird. 
(Grosses N bedeutet ausfuehrliches Protokoll, kleines N ein sparsames Protokoll.

--------!-debug-G---------------------------
-debug N:          Erzeugt Protokoll-Ausgabe level N (1-8) 
                   (Default: Debug ausgeschaltet)
-debug all:        Erzeugt sehr ausfuehrliches Protokoll

--------!-delta-G---------------------------
-delta N:          Das ist die maximal erlaubte Farbabweichung zwischen der
                   ersten Ebene (dem 'rohen' Bild und der zweiten Ebene (dem 
                   'Detail'-Bild). Die 'Detail-Ebene enthaelt eine Vektor-
                   darstellung nur jener Gebiete, die eine Farbabweichung
                   von mehr als N Einheiten zur 1.ten Ebene aufweisen.
                   Achtung: 'delta' hat zwei verschiedene Bedeutungen:
                   In Verbindung mit der 'progressive' - Option bedeutet
                   der Wert die max. Farbabweichung zwischen 2 Ebenen. In
                   Verbindung mit der 'vcolor' - Option bedeutet der Wert
                   eine max. zulaessige Farb-Toleranz.
                   Werte: 0 bis 128. Default: 0

--------!-errbez-G--------------------------
-errbez N:         Gibt den Wert N fuer den Bezier Error-Parameter an.
                   Erlaubte Werte sind: 1 - 20. Groessere Werte fuer errbez
                   fuehren zu groesseren Differenzen zwischen dem Original-
                   und dem Vektor-Bild, reduzieren jedoch die Groesse der
		   Ausgabe-Datei. Der Default-Wert betraegt 3.

--------!-group-G---------------------------
-group:            Erzeugt rekursiv verschachtelte Gruppen von Objekten.
                   Dieser Parameter gilt nur fuer Das LogoArt-Format.

--------!-lossless-G------------------------
-lossless:         Die Vektorisierung soll ohne Informationsverlust erfolgen.
                   Die Angabe dieser Option kann enorme Speicheranforderungen
                   zur Folge haben.
                   Diese Option ist identisch mit der Einstellung:
                   -resolution high -grit 0 -reduce orth. -quantize (Unendlich)

--------!-process-G-------------------------
-process <list>:   KVEC hat einige Bildverarbeitungs Features eingebaut, die
                   kaum in anderen Bildverarbeitungs-Programmen gefunden  
                   werden. Sie koennen eine Liste von Befehlen nach dem
                   'process' keyword angeben. Diese Befehle muessen entweder
                   als Zeichenketten oder als Funktionsnummern angegeben
                   werden und muessen voneinander durch eines der folgenden 
                   Zeichen getrennt werdens: ',',':','.','-'.
                   Die Zeichenketten koennen abgekuerzt werden.
                   Die Befehle werden ausgefuehrt, sobald das Bild eingelesen
                   (oder automatisch durch den 'random' Switch erzeugt)
                   wurde. Hier einige Beispiele:

                   Die (erste) Anweisung 'byte2complex' und die (letzte) An-
                   weisung 'complex2byte' brauchen nicht angegeben zu werden,
                   da sie von KVEC automatisch ausgefuehrt werden.
                   Bsp. 2:
                   Dies weist KVEC an, eine Fourier-Transformation des Bildes
                   auszufuehren, die Logarithmus Funktion anzuwenden, die 
                   Werte auf den Bereich [0..255] zu normieren und den Bild-   
                   Ursprung in die Mitte des Bildes zu legen (was fuer    
                   Frequenz-Darstellungen sehr viel besser geeignet ist).
                   Danach faehrt KVEC mit der Auswertung der anderen Parameter
                   fort.                            

                   BITTE BEACHTEN SIE, DASS DIE BITMAP IN EINE KOMPLEXE
                   BITMAP UMGEWANDELT WERDEN MUSS. DAS KANN ZU RIESIGEN
                   SPEICHERANFORDERUNGEN FUEHREN!
                   
                   Hier ein Beispiel: Eine 500 * 500 Bitmap mit einer
                   Farbtiefe von 4 Bit (Paletten Bitmap) belegt einen Speicher 
                   von 500*500*1/2 *sizeof(BYTE) = 125 KByte. Die konvertierte
                   komplexe Bitmap belegt
                   500*500*(3 Farbebenen)*sizeof(COMPLEX) = 6 MByte!

                   Hier ist die Befehlsliste und die entsprechenden Funktions

GRAY2COLOR: Die Farbtiefe des erzeugten Farbbildes (Default: 8 Bit) kann mit
            Hilfe der Option '-random <Farbtiefe> <N> eingestellt werden.
            In diesem Fall wird der Wert <N> ignoriert.

--------!-progressive-G---------------------
KVEC bietet die Moeglichkeit, einen progressiven Bildaufbau zu erzeugen.
Der Ausdruck 'progressiv' bedeutet, dass das Bild aus zwei aufeinander 
folgenden Ebenen (einem 'groben' Bild ohne Details und einem 'feinem' Bild,
das nur Datails enthaelt) aufgebaut wird. Die beiden Ebenen folgen in dieser 
Reihenfolge beim Zeichnen. Diese Art des Bildaufbaues ist sehr robust gegen
alle Arten von Rotationen, Dehnungen oder lokalen Deformationen. Die Unter-
schiede dieser beiden Ebenen in Bezug auf Farbquantisierung und dem 'grit'-
Wert werden durch den 'colorfactor' und dem 'gritfactor' ausgedrueckt.

-progressive gritfactor N:   Erzeugt ein progressives Bild aus zwei Ebenen
                             Die erste Ebene hat einen mit N multiplizierten
                             'grit'-Wert
-progressive colorfactor N:  Erzeugt ein progressives Bild aus zwei Ebenen
                             Die erste Ebene hat einen durch N dividierten
                             'quantize'-Wert

--------!-random-G--------------------------
-random N1 N2:     Erzeugt ein Zufalls-Testbild als Input. Der Name der   
                   Input Datei sollte in diesem Fall 'null' oder 'vnull'sein.
                   Der Parameter N1 gibt die Farbtiefe des Testbildes an.
                   Gueltige Werte: 1,4,8,24.
                   N2 gibt den Typ des Bildes an.
                   Erlaubte Werte fuer N2 fuer Raster-Bilder ('null'):
                   0 or 1 (SW oder Grau), 2 (farbiges Bild)
                   Die Werte 0,1, oder 2 fuer N2 erzeugen jeweils 'weisses'
				   Rauschen und sind deshalb fuer Vektorisierung ungeeignet.
                   Werte 3 oder 4 fuer N2 (erzeugt ein Testbild...) sind
                   zum Testen der Vektorisierung besser geeignet.
                          N2 = 3: Bekanntes Logo
                          N2 = 4: Space-Shuttle
                          N2 = 5: Testbild mit 16777216 versch. Farben
                   Erlaubte Werte fuer N2 fuer Vektor-Bilder ('vnull'):
                   0: Zufalls-Polylines, 1: gefuellte Zufalls-Polygone
                   2: Alle moeglichen KVEC Objekte
                   Werte 3 oder 4 fuer N2 erzeugt ein Testbild
                          N2 = 3: Schmetterling
                          N2 = 4: Tigerkopf

--------!-scmode-G--------------------------
                   (GUI-Parameter) Waehlt den Skalierungsmodus in der KVEC-GUI.
                   Hinweis: Wird von der KVEC Kommandozeilenversion ignoriert. 
-scmode N:         0: Isotrop, 1: Isotrop, 2: Anisotrop, 3: Keine Skalierung

--------!-smooth-G--------------------------
-smooth on:        Glaettung von Polylines und Polygonen. Das Programm
                   versucht, Vektoren zu glaetten. Diese Einstellung ist mit
                   einem gewissen Bild-Informationsverlust verbunden.
                   Default: haengt vom Ausgabe-Format ab.
                   Wird 'smooth on' beim Format WMF oder EMF verwendet, so
                   erhoeht sich die Aufloesung um den Faktor 4.
-smooth off:       Schaltet die Glaettungsfunktion aus

--------!-subimage-G------------------------
-subimage N:       Waehlt das Bild Nr. N in einer Graphik-Datei aus, die mehr
                   als ein Bild enthaelt (Tiff, OS/2 Bitmaps oder FAX Formate)
                   Das erste Bild beginnt mit Nr. 0. Falls kein subimage Wert
                   angegeben wurde, erzeugt KVEC ein einziges Bild, in dem
                   alle Subimages aneinander 'gehaengt' werden (Nur fuer FAX)

--------!-xyscale-G-------------------------
KVEC bietet die Mglichkeit einer anisotropen Skalierung / Translation fuer
DXF und HPGL output:
-xyscale hpgl X Y: Skaliere hpgl Koordinaten mit Faktor X (x-Richtung) und
                   Y (y-Richtung)
-xyscale dxf X Y:  Skaliere dxf Koordinaten mit Faktor X (x-Richtung) und
                   Y (y-Richtung)
-xyoffset X Y:     Addiere X und Y Offsets zu den Ausgabekoordinaten
                   (Die Option '-coord pixel' sollte dann angegeben werden!)

--------!-vcolor-G--------------------------
-vcolor R G B:     Diese Option kann benutzt werden, um aus einem Bild
                   bestimmte Bereiche, naemlich die mit den RGB-
                   Farbkomponenten R,G,B, 'herauszuholen'.
                   Die Werte fuer R,G,B koennen zwischen 0 und 255 liegen.
                   Die Vektor-Outputdatei wird nur Bereiche mit dieser Farbe
                   enthalten.
                   Achtung: Falls ein Delta Wert > 0 angegeben wurde
                   ('-delta Option) werden alle Farben vektorisiert, die im
                   Bereich (RGB +/- delta) liegen.
-vcolor -R -G -B:  Die Vektor-Outputdatei keine Bereiche mit dieser Farbe
                   enthalten.
                   Achtung: Falls ein Delta Wert > 0 angegeben wurde
                   ('-delta Option) werden keine Farben vektorisiert, die im
                   Bereich (RGB +/- delta) liegen.
